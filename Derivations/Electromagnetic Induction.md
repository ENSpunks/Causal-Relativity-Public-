### **t = 0**  
**Causal Geometry:** Light  
**Phenomenon:** Electromagnetic Induction  
**Theory:** Classical Electromagnetism

\]

### **1. Causal Geometry**  
#### **1.1 Phenomenon:**  
- The equation describes the relationship between magnetic fields and electric currents or time-varying electric fields.  
- It is one of Maxwell's equations, specifically Ampère's law with Maxwell's correction, which accounts for the displacement current (\(\mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}\)) essential for electromagnetic wave propagation.  

#### **1.2 Theory:**  
- **Classical Electromagnetism:** This theory unifies electricity, magnetism, and light.  
- Ampère's law, originally focused on the magnetic fields created by currents, was extended by James Clerk Maxwell to include the effects of changing electric fields, enabling the prediction of self-sustaining electromagnetic waves.  
- Maxwell's correction bridged the gap between theory and experimental evidence for electromagnetic waves traveling at the speed of light.  

#### **1.3 Original Equation:**  
\[
\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J} + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}
\]  
- \( \nabla \times \mathbf{B} \): The curl of the magnetic field, representing its rotational nature.  
- \( \mu_0 \): Permeability of free space.  
- \( \mathbf{J} \): Current density.  
- \( \epsilon_0 \): Permittivity of free space.  
- \( \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} \): Time rate of change of the electric field.  

#### **1.4 Relativity Equation:**  
The relativistic version introduces the effect of the divergence of the electric field:  
\[
\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J} + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \kappa \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E}
\]  
- \( \kappa \): A proportionality constant reflecting relativistic corrections.  
- This adjustment accounts for non-standard scenarios where \(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E}\) is significant, such as in anisotropic media or under extreme conditions.

### **2. Derivation**  
1. **Start with Maxwell’s Equations:**  
   - Ampère’s Law with Maxwell’s correction:  
     \[
     \nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J} + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}
     \]  

2. **Introduce Relativistic Corrections:**  
   - Modify the equation to include divergence effects of the electric field:  
     \[
     \nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J} + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \kappa \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E}
     \]  

3. **Interpretation of \( \kappa \):**  
   - \( \kappa \) reflects conditions where the divergence of \(\mathbf{E}\) contributes to the curl of \(\mathbf{B}\), potentially altering wave behavior in extreme electromagnetic environments.  

4. **Reconcile Classical and Relativistic Forms:**  
   - For \(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = 0\), as in vacuum or isotropic media, the relativistic form simplifies back to the classical equation.  

---

### **3. Validation**  
- **Experimental Evidence:**  
  - Ampère’s Law with Maxwell’s correction is foundational in predicting and observing electromagnetic waves.  
  - Displacement currents, as predicted by Maxwell, are experimentally verified through technologies like radio transmission and electromagnetic wave detectors.  
- **Relativity Equation Validation:**  
  - While not observed in standard conditions, the modified equation may describe exotic systems or extensions of classical electromagnetism under specific constraints.

### **4. Sample Problem**  
#### **4.1 Problem Statement:**  
Consider a parallel plate capacitor with a time-varying electric field \( \mathbf{E}(t) = E_0 \cos(\omega t) \) between the plates. Calculate the induced magnetic field \( \mathbf{B}(t) \) outside the capacitor using the classical form of Ampère’s Law with Maxwell’s correction.  

#### **4.2 Solution/Calculation:**  
1. **Given:**  
   - \( \mathbf{E}(t) = E_0 \cos(\omega t) \).  
   - Ampère’s Law:  
     \[
     \nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}
     \]  

2. **Calculate \( \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} \):**  
   \[
   \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} = -E_0 \omega \sin(\omega t)
   \]  

3. **Substitute into Ampère’s Law:**  
   \[
   \nabla \times \mathbf{B} = -\mu_0 \epsilon_0 E_0 \omega \sin(\omega t)
   \]  

4. **Solve for \( \mathbf{B}(t) \):**  
   - For a symmetric configuration:  
     \[
     \mathbf{B}(t) = \frac{-\mu_0 \epsilon_0 E_0 \omega}{k} \sin(\omega t)
     \]  
   - \( k \) is a constant dependent on geometry.  

5. **Result:**  
   The magnetic field oscillates as \( \mathbf{B}(t) \propto \sin(\omega t) \), in phase with the changing electric field.
