### **1. Causal Geometry**  
#### **1.1 Phenomenon:**  
- The phenomenon of dark energy is integral to understanding the accelerating expansion of the universe. At the time of the Big Bang, the energy density of the universe was dominated by dark energy, contributing to the rapid expansion of space during the inflationary epoch.
- Dark energy, in the form of a **cosmological constant** or other quantum fields, acts as a repulsive force that accelerates the expansion of the universe. Understanding its density at the time of the Big Bang provides insight into the underlying forces driving inflation and the early universe's evolution.

#### **1.2 Theory:**  
- The **inflationary model** of the early universe suggests a rapid exponential expansion driven by a vacuum energy field, which is often associated with dark energy. The energy density of dark energy at the time of the Big Bang is related to the **Hubble parameter** \( H(t) \), which governs the rate of expansion of the universe.
- In classical General Relativity, dark energy is often modeled as a **cosmological constant**, \( \Lambda \), which leads to a constant energy density. However, in more advanced theories, including **Causal Relativity**, dark energy may be modeled as a dynamic field, subject to quantum fluctuations and causal boundaries imposed by the rapid expansion.
- The cosmological constant \( \Lambda \) can be related to the **vacuum energy density**, and during inflation, the equation of state of dark energy was nearly \( w \approx -1 \), where \( p = w \rho \), with \( p \) being the pressure and \( \rho \) the energy density.

#### **1.3 Original Equation:**  
- The original equation for the energy density of dark energy at the time of the Big Bang, using the Hubble parameter \( H_0 \) (the current value of the Hubble constant), is:

\[
\rho_{\text{DE}}(t=0) = \frac{3 H_0^2}{8 \pi G}
\]

Where:
- \( \rho_{\text{DE}}(t=0) \) is the dark energy density at the time of the Big Bang.
- \( H_0 \) is the Hubble constant.
- \( G \) is the gravitational constant.

This equation provides the initial value of the dark energy density during the early universe, based on the expansion rate of the universe.

#### **1.4 Relativity Equation:**  
- In **Causal Relativity**, the dark energy density can be influenced by quantum fluctuations near the **causal horizon** of the universe. The expansion of the universe introduces a correction factor that accounts for the interaction between the quantum field of dark energy and the growing causal boundaries at the time of the Big Bang.
- The modified equation in Causal Relativity is given by:

\[
\rho_{\text{DE, causal}}(t=0) = \frac{3 H_0^2}{8 \pi G} \left( 1 + \Delta \rho_{\text{DE}} \right)
\]

Where:
- \( \Delta \rho_{\text{DE}} \) represents a quantum fluctuation in the dark energy density due to causal effects at the time of the Big Bang. This term accounts for the non-static nature of dark energy during inflation and the causal interactions between different regions of spacetime.

### **2. Derivation**  

- To derive the original dark energy density equation, we start with **Einstein's field equations** for a homogeneous and isotropic universe:

\[
R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2} g_{\mu\nu} R + g_{\mu\nu} \Lambda = 8 \pi G T_{\mu\nu}
\]

Where:
- \( R_{\mu\nu} \) is the Ricci curvature tensor.
- \( \Lambda \) is the cosmological constant.
- \( T_{\mu\nu} \) is the stress-energy tensor.

- For a flat universe during inflation, the **Friedmann equations** describe the expansion:

\[
H^2 = \frac{8 \pi G}{3} \rho_{\text{DE}}
\]

Where:
- \( H \) is the Hubble parameter.
- \( \rho_{\text{DE}} \) is the dark energy density.

- At the time of the Big Bang, the Hubble parameter \( H_0 \) can be substituted into the equation to obtain the original dark energy density:

\[
\rho_{\text{DE}}(t=0) = \frac{3 H_0^2}{8 \pi G}
\]

- In **Causal Relativity**, quantum fluctuations in the causal region lead to the introduction of a correction term \( \Delta \rho_{\text{DE}} \), which accounts for the rapid expansion and the quantum interactions near the causal boundary:

\[
\rho_{\text{DE, causal}}(t=0) = \frac{3 H_0^2}{8 \pi G} \left( 1 + \Delta \rho_{\text{DE}} \right)
\]

This equation modifies the original formula, introducing corrections based on the quantum dynamics of dark energy during inflation.

### **3. Validation**  

- **Experimental Confirmation:** The exact value of the dark energy density at the time of the Big Bang is difficult to determine directly due to the lack of observable data from the very early universe. However, the effects of dark energy on the expansion of the universe are observable through the **cosmic microwave background (CMB)** and the large-scale structure of the universe.
  
- **Observational Evidence:** Modern observations of the **accelerating expansion of the universe**, particularly through **Type Ia supernovae** and the **cosmic distance ladder**, provide indirect evidence of dark energy's presence. These observations suggest that dark energy is responsible for approximately 68% of the total energy density of the universe.
  
- The inclusion of **Causal Relativity** corrections is speculative but could be tested in the future through **quantum cosmology** and simulations of the early universe that incorporate quantum gravitational effects.

### **4. Sample Problem**  
#### **4.1 Problem Statement:**  
Calculate the dark energy density at the time of the Big Bang for a universe with \( H_0 = 70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc} \), and apply a causal correction \( \Delta \rho_{\text{DE}} = 0.1 \).

#### **4.2 Solution/Calculation:**  
1. Convert the Hubble constant to SI units:

\[
H_0 = 70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc} = 2.29 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{s}^{-1}
\]

2. Using the original equation for dark energy density:

\[
\rho_{\text{DE}}(t=0) = \frac{3 H_0^2}{8 \pi G}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\rho_{\text{DE}}(t=0) = \frac{3 (2.29 \times 10^{-18})^2}{8 \pi (6.674 \times 10^{-11})}
\]

3. Calculate:

\[
\rho_{\text{DE}}(t=0) \approx 9.28 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg/m}^3
\]

4. Apply the **Causal Relativity correction** with \( \Delta \rho_{\text{DE}} = 0.1 \):

\[
\rho_{\text{DE, causal}}(t=0) = 9.28 \times 10^{-27} \left( 1 + 0.1 \right) \, \text{kg/m}^3
\]

5. Calculate:

\[
\rho_{\text{DE, causal}}(t=0) \approx 1.02 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{kg/m}^3
\]

Thus, the dark energy density with the Causal Relativity correction is approximately \( 1.02 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{kg/m}^3 \), which is slightly higher than the original value.
