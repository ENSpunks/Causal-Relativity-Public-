### **t = 0**  
**Causal Geometry:** The path integral approach is reinterpreted as a summation over all possible spatial paths within causal spheres.  
**Phenomenon:** Quantum mechanics described through the probability of spatial configurations rather than paths through spacetime.  
**Theory:** Feynman's path integral method adapted to a spatial-only context, where causality is dictated by spatial interactions.  
**Original Equation:** 
\[
\psi(x_f, t_f) = \int \mathcal{D}x \, \exp\left(\frac{i}{\hbar} S[x]\right)
\]

### **1. Causal Geometry**  
#### **1.1 Phenomenon:**  
- The path integral formulation calculates the probability amplitude for a particle moving from one spatial point to another by summing over all possible paths in space.

#### **1.2 Theory:**  
- Developed by Richard Feynman, this method provides a quantum mechanical description where every possible path contributes to the total probability. In causal relativity, paths are through space alone.

#### **1.3 Original Equation:**  
- \( \psi(x_f, t_f) = \int \mathcal{D}x \, \exp\left(\frac{i}{\hbar} S[x]\right) \)
- Feynman introduced this formulation to handle quantum mechanics in terms of action.

#### **1.4 Relativity Equation:**  
- \( \psi(\mathbf{r}_f) = \int \mathcal{D}\mathbf{r} \, \exp\left(\frac{i}{\hbar} S[\mathbf{r}]\right) \)
- Here, \( \mathbf{r} \) represents spatial paths within the causal sphere, and \( S[\mathbf{r}] \) is the action in spatial terms.

### **2. Derivation**  

- **Step 1:** Define the action \( S[\mathbf{r}] \) for paths within the causal sphere, considering how spatial interactions affect the phase.

- **Step 2:** Sum over all possible spatial paths from an initial to a final spatial configuration, using the principle of least action in a spatial context.

- **Step 3:** Adjust the integration measure \( \mathcal{D}\mathbf{r} \) to account for spatial causality, possibly involving constraints from causal geometry.

- **Step 4:** Calculate the phase factor using spatial interactions, which replace temporal evolution.

### **3. Validation**  

- **Validation**: 
  - This method should predict the same quantum mechanical outcomes as traditional path integrals for stationary states or spatial phenomena like interference.
  - Simulations would need to show how spatial paths reproduce quantum effects.

- **Limitations**: 
  - Explaining phenomena that rely on temporal interference like decay or oscillations might require new interpretations.

### **4. Sample Problem**  
#### **4.1 Problem Statement:**  
- Determine the probability amplitude for a particle moving from point A to B within a gravitational well (Alice's mass sphere) using the path integral.

#### **4.2 Solution/Calculation:**  
- **Action**: Define the action \( S[\mathbf{r}] \) including the gravitational potential within the causal sphere.
- **Path Integration**: Sum over all paths considering gravitational bending, leading to a spatial interpretation of quantum tunneling or wave-like behavior.
