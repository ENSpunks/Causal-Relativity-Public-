### **1. Causal Geometry**  
#### **1.1 Phenomenon:**  
- The path integral formulation calculates the probability amplitude for a particle moving from one spatial point to another by summing over all possible paths in space.

#### **1.2 Theory:**  
- Developed by Richard Feynman, this method provides a quantum mechanical description where every possible path contributes to the total probability. In causal relativity, paths are through space alone.

#### **1.3 Original Equation:**  
- \( \psi(x_f, t_f) = \int \mathcal{D}x \, \exp\left(\frac{i}{\hbar} S[x]\right) \)
- Feynman introduced this formulation to handle quantum mechanics in terms of action.

#### **1.4 Relativity Equation:**  
- \( \psi(\mathbf{r}_f) = \int \mathcal{D}\mathbf{r} \, \exp\left(\frac{i}{\hbar} S[\mathbf{r}]\right) \)
- Here, \( \mathbf{r} \) represents spatial paths within the causal sphere, and \( S[\mathbf{r}] \) is the action in spatial terms.

---

### **2. Derivation**  

- **Step 1:** Define the action \( S[\mathbf{r}] \) for paths within the causal sphere, considering how spatial interactions affect the phase.

- **Step 2:** Sum over all possible spatial paths from an initial to a final spatial configuration, using the principle of least action in a spatial context.

- **Step 3:** Adjust the integration measure \( \mathcal{D}\mathbf{r} \) to account for spatial causality, possibly involving constraints from causal geometry.

- **Step 4:** Calculate the phase factor using spatial interactions, which replace temporal evolution.

---

### **3. Validation**  

- **Validation**: 
  - This method should predict the same quantum mechanical outcomes as traditional path integrals for stationary states or spatial phenomena like interference.
  - Simulations would need to show how spatial paths reproduce quantum effects.

- **Limitations**: 
  - Explaining phenomena that rely on temporal interference like decay or oscillations might require new interpretations.

## **Causal Relativity Equation: Klein-Gordon Equation**

*Author: Will Brown*

### **t = 0**  
**Causal Geometry:** Scalar fields and their interactions are described through spatial configurations in causal spheres.  
**Phenomenon:** Relativistic quantum mechanics for spinless particles without time.  
**Theory:** The Klein-Gordon equation reinterpreted to describe particle dynamics through spatial causality.  
**Original Equation:** 
\[
(\Box + \frac{m^2c^2}{\hbar^2})\psi = 0
\]
---

### **1. Causal Geometry**  
#### **1.1 Phenomenon:**  
- This equation describes the relativistic behavior of spinless particles. In causal relativity, we focus on how these particles' fields interact spatially.

#### **1.2 Theory:**  
- The Klein-Gordon equation was derived for relativistic wave mechanics. Here, we adapt it for a time-less framework.

#### **1.3 Original Equation:**  
- \( (\Box + \frac{m^2c^2}{\hbar^2})\psi = 0 \)

#### **1.4 Relativity Equation:**  
- \( (-\nabla^2 + \frac{m^2c^2}{\hbar^2})\psi(\mathbf{r}) = 0 \)
- Here, \( \Box \) is reduced to \( -\nabla^2 \), focusing on spatial derivatives.

---

### **2. Derivation**  

- **Step 1:** Begin with the relativistic energy-momentum relation, but focus only on spatial components.

- **Step 2:** Apply the spatial Laplacian operator to reflect changes in the field due to spatial interactions.

- **Step 3:** Solve for \( \psi(\mathbf{r}) \) where the equation represents the equilibrium of spatial forces and particle mass within the causal sphere.

- **Step 4:** Adjust for the causal geometry where spatial curvature might affect the field's behavior.

---

### **3. Validation**  

- **Validation**: 
  - This should predict behaviors of mesons or other spin-0 particles in scenarios where time effects are minimal or can be spatially interpreted.
  - Compare with experiments involving particle scattering or decay in strong fields.

- **Limitations**: 
  - Must explain phenomena like particle creation/annihilation without invoking time.

---

### **4. Sample Problem**  
#### **4.1 Problem Statement:**

## **Causal Relativity Equation: Heisenberg Equation of Motion**

*Author: Will Brown*

### **t = 0**  
**Causal Geometry:** Operator dynamics are described through spatial interactions within causal spheres.  
**Phenomenon:** Evolution of quantum operators due to spatial causality.  
**Theory:** Quantum mechanics where operator evolution is dictated by spatial configurations rather than time.  
**Original Equation:** 
\[
i\hbar \frac{d \hat{A}}{dt} = [\hat{A}, \hat{H}]
\]
---

### **1. Causal Geometry**  
#### **1.1 Phenomenon:**  
- The Heisenberg equation describes how operators evolve in quantum mechanics. Here, we consider how operators change with spatial interactions.

#### **1.2 Theory:**  
- Werner Heisenberg's formulation for quantum dynamics. In causal relativity, we adapt this to describe spatial changes in operator values.

#### **1.3 Original Equation:**  
- \( i\hbar \frac{d \hat{A}}{dt} = [\hat{A}, \hat{H}] \)

#### **1.4 Relativity Equation:**  
- \( [\hat{A}, \hat{H}_{\text{causal}}] = 0 \) for stationary states, or an equivalent for spatial evolution where the change in operator is due to spatial interaction:
  - A potential form could be \( \hat{A}(\mathbf{r}_f) = \hat{U}(\mathbf{r}_f, \mathbf{r}_i) \hat{A}(\mathbf{r}_i) \hat{U}^\dagger(\mathbf{r}_f, \mathbf{r}_i) \) where \( \hat{U} \) is a spatial evolution operator.

---

### **2. Derivation**  

- **Step 1:** Recognize that in causal relativity, the evolution of an operator is due to spatial changes rather than time.

- **Step 2:** Define a spatial evolution operator \( \hat{U} \) based on the causal Hamiltonian, which dictates how operators change as a particle moves through different spatial configurations.

- **Step 3:** Use the commutation relations to understand how operators evolve concerning spatial shifts, potentially leading to a new form of the Heisenberg equation that reflects spatial causality.

- **Step 4:** Solve for specific operators in scenarios where spatial geometry dictates their behavior.

---

### **3. Validation**  

- **Validation**: 
  - Must predict how observables like position or momentum change in scenarios where spatial interactions dominate, like in strong gravitational fields.
  - Simulations or calculations could compare these predictions with traditional quantum dynamics.

- **Limitations**: 
  - The concept of 'evolution' without time needs careful redefinition to align with observable quantum phenomena.
