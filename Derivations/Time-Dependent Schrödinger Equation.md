### **t = 0**  
**Causal Geometry:** Quantum state evolution is described by spatial interactions within causal spheres, replacing time with spatial causality.  
**Phenomenon:** Evolution of quantum states without explicit time, focusing on spatial dynamics.  
**Theory:** Quantum mechanics reinterpreted to define state changes through spatial configurations.  
**Original Equation:** 
\[
i\hbar \frac{\partial \psi(x,t)}{\partial t} = \hat{H} \psi(x,t)
\]

### **1. Causal Geometry**  
#### **1.1 Phenomenon:**  
- This equation typically describes how quantum systems evolve over time. In causal relativity, we explore how quantum states can change through spatial interactions, where 'evolution' is redefined as a spatial shift within the causal sphere.

#### **1.2 Theory:**  
- In traditional quantum mechanics, the time-dependent Schrödinger equation is fundamental for understanding dynamics. Here, we propose that these dynamics result from spatial interactions, redefining causality.

#### **1.3 Original Equation:**  
- \( i\hbar \frac{\partial \psi(x,t)}{\partial t} = \hat{H} \psi(x,t) \)
- This was also developed by Erwin Schrödinger to include time-dependent phenomena.

#### **1.4 Causal Relativity Equation:**  
- \( \hat{H}_{\text{causal}} \psi(\mathbf{r}) = E_{\text{causal}} \psi(\mathbf{r}) \)
- In this framework, we might consider \( E_{\text{causal}} \) as varying with spatial configuration rather than time, suggesting a form of spatial 'evolution'.

### **2. Derivation**  

- **Step 1:** Start with recognizing that in causal relativity, the dynamics of the system are described by how spatial configurations shift.

- **Step 2:** Define a 'spatial evolution' operator that replaces the temporal derivative with a spatial operator representing interaction changes:
  \[
  \hat{H}_{\text{causal}} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 + V(\mathbf{r})
  \]
  Here, \( V(\mathbf{r}) \) might include terms reflecting causal interactions.

- **Step 3:** Solve for \( \psi(\mathbf{r}) \) under different spatial configurations to simulate 'evolution'. This involves understanding how spatial changes in the potential or geometry affect the wave function.

- **Step 4:** The equation becomes a tool for understanding how spatial perturbations cause shifts in quantum states, akin to temporal evolution but through spatial causality.

### **3. Validation**  

- **Validation**: 
  - Experimental scenarios like quantum tunneling or wave packet spreading could be reimagined in terms of spatial interactions.
  - Simulations would need to show how 'evolution' in this context matches or predicts outcomes without invoking time.

- **Limitations**: 
  - Explaining phenomena like decay or oscillation without time would challenge conventional interpretations.

### **4. Sample Problem**  
#### **4.1 Problem Statement:**  
- Consider an electron moving through a spatially varying potential within a causal sphere. How does its wave function evolve spatially?

#### **4.2 Solution/Calculation:**  
- **Hamiltonian**: 
  \[
  \hat{H}_{\text{causal}} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 + V(\mathbf{r})
  \]
  where \( V(\mathbf{r}) \) varies spatially.

- **Wave function Evolution**: 
  - Instead of solving for time evolution, solve for changes in \( \psi(\mathbf{r}) \) as \( \mathbf{r} \) changes due to spatial interactions or potential variations.

- **Example**: If \( V(\mathbf{r}) \) represents a barrier, describe how the wave function spreads or tunnels through in terms of spatial probability distribution.

### **5. AI Prompt**  
- Draft an "AI Prompt" to validate the Time-Dependent Schrödinger Equation in Causal Relativity:  
  "Simulate the spatial evolution of an electron's wave function in a varying potential within Alice's causal sphere. Determine how spatial interactions lead to what would traditionally be considered temporal evolution. Compare these spatial dynamics to traditional quantum mechanics predictions."
