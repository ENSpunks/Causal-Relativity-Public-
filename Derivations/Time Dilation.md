### **1. Causal Geometry**  
#### **1.1 Phenomenon:**  
- Time dilation refers to the phenomenon where time appears to pass more slowly for an observer moving at high velocity relative to a stationary observer. This effect is predicted by the theory of special relativity.  
- The equation shows how time intervals measured by two observers will differ depending on their relative velocities. The faster an object moves, the slower its clock runs compared to the clock of an observer at rest.  

#### **1.2 Theory:**  
- **Special Relativity:** Special Relativity, proposed by Einstein in 1905, posits that the speed of light is constant in all reference frames and that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames.  
- Time dilation is one of the core predictions of special relativity. According to the theory, as an object moves closer to the speed of light, time for that object (in its own reference frame) appears to slow down from the perspective of an external observer.  
- This effect only becomes noticeable at velocities close to the speed of light, and is negligible at everyday speeds.

#### **1.3 Original Equation:**  
The original equation for time dilation is given by:
\[
\Delta t' = \gamma \Delta t
\]
- \( \Delta t' \): The time interval measured by the moving observer.  
- \( \Delta t \): The time interval measured by the stationary observer.  
- \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor:
  \[
  \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
  \]
- This equation shows that the moving observer's time \( \Delta t' \) will be dilated (slowed down) compared to the time \( \Delta t \) of the stationary observer, with the factor \( \gamma \) determining the amount of dilation.

#### **1.4 Relativity Equation:**  
The relativity equation for length contraction is similar, with the time dilation effect influencing both time and length:
\[
\Delta L' = \Delta L \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
\]
- \( \Delta L' \): The contracted length observed by the moving observer.  
- \( \Delta L \): The proper length measured in the rest frame of the object.  
- This equation expresses how time dilation affects both time intervals and distances, depending on the relative velocity.

### **2. Derivation**  
1. **Starting Point:**  
   - Time dilation is a consequence of the Lorentz transformations, which relate the coordinates of time and space between different inertial frames.  
   - The Lorentz transformation for time is given by:
     \[
     t' = \gamma (t - \frac{vx}{c^2})
     \]
     where \( t' \) is the time in the moving frame, \( t \) is the time in the stationary frame, \( v \) is the relative velocity between the frames, \( x \) is the spatial coordinate, and \( c \) is the speed of light.

2. **Time Dilation:**  
   - If we consider an event that occurs at the same position in the moving frame (i.e., \( x' = 0 \)), the time dilation equation simplifies to:
     \[
     t' = \gamma t
     \]
     This shows that the time \( t' \) measured in the moving frame is longer than the time \( t \) measured in the stationary frame by the factor \( \gamma \).

3. **Final Equation:**  
   - The time interval for the moving observer is dilated relative to the stationary observerâ€™s time interval, and the amount of dilation increases as the velocity \( v \) approaches the speed of light. The equation \( \Delta t' = \gamma \Delta t \) encapsulates this effect.

### **3. Validation**  
- **Experimental Evidence:**  
  - Time dilation has been experimentally validated using atomic clocks. In one famous experiment, atomic clocks flown in airplanes showed a difference in elapsed time compared to clocks left on the ground, consistent with the predictions of special relativity.  
  - Particle accelerators also provide evidence for time dilation, as high-speed particles decay more slowly when moving at velocities close to the speed of light. These results align with the time dilation equation.  

- **Limitations:**  
  - Time dilation is most noticeable when an object moves at speeds approaching the speed of light. At everyday speeds, the effect is so small that it cannot be observed.  
  - The equation assumes that the object is moving at constant velocity in an inertial reference frame. Time dilation is not applicable in non-inertial frames (e.g., objects under acceleration).

### **4. Sample Problem**  
#### **4.1 Problem Statement:**  
A spaceship is traveling at 90% of the speed of light relative to Earth. A clock on the spaceship measures a time interval of 1 hour. What is the time interval measured by an observer on Earth?  

#### **4.2 Solution/Calculation:**  
1. **Given:**  
   - Proper time on spaceship, \( \Delta t = 1 \, \text{hour} \)  
   - Velocity, \( v = 0.9c \)  
   - Speed of light, \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)  

2. **Apply the Time Dilation Equation:**  
   \[
   \Delta t' = \gamma \Delta t
   \]
   where:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
   \]
   Substituting \( v = 0.9c \):
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.9)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.81}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.19}} \approx 2.294
   \]

3. **Calculate the Time Interval on Earth:**
   \[
   \Delta t' = 2.294 \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 2.294 \, \text{hours}
   \]

4. **Final Result:**  
   - The time interval observed by the Earth-based observer is approximately 2.294 hours.
