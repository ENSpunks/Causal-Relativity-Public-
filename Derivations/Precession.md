### **1. Causal Geometry**  
#### **1.1 Phenomenon:**  
- **Precession** refers to the gradual shift in the orientation of the orbit of a celestial body. In particular, we discuss the phenomenon of *orbital precession* in the context of General Relativity, where light orbits near massive objects, such as a planet or a star, orbits may not follow exact elliptical paths as predicted by Newtonian physics.  
- This phenomenon occurs due to the curvature of spacetime caused by a massive object like a planet or star. In General Relativity, the curvature affects the motion of orbiting bodies, causing a slow, continuous shift in the orbit's orientation. The most famous example of this is the precession of the perihelion of Mercury’s orbit around the Sun, which cannot be fully explained by Newtonian mechanics but is accurately predicted by General Relativity.

#### **1.2 Theory:**  
- **General Relativity:** The curvature of spacetime described by Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity explains gravitational forces as the result of massive objects bending the fabric of spacetime. Objects moving in the vicinity of such massive bodies follow curved paths (geodesics), leading to phenomena like gravitational lensing, orbital precession, and time dilation.  
- **Orbital Precession:** Orbital precession occurs because of the effects of spacetime curvature on the trajectory of orbiting bodies. For example, in the two-body problem, Newtonian mechanics predicts that two bodies orbiting each other will do so in perfectly elliptical paths (as described by Kepler's laws). However, General Relativity predicts that these paths will slowly rotate over time due to the curvature of spacetime caused by the massive object at the center of the orbit. This results in a continuous shift in the orientation of the orbit, referred to as precession.

#### **1.3 Original Equation:**  
The equation for orbital precession in General Relativity is given by:
\[
\Delta \phi = \frac{6 \pi G M}{c^2 a (1 - e^2)}
\]
Where:
- \( \Delta \phi \): The change in the orientation of the orbit (the angle through which the perihelion shifts).
- \( G \): The gravitational constant.
- \( M \): The mass of the central object causing the gravitational field (e.g., the Sun for Mercury’s orbit).
- \( c \): The speed of light.
- \( a \): The semi-major axis of the elliptical orbit.
- \( e \): The eccentricity of the orbit, which quantifies how elongated the ellipse is (a value between 0 and 1).

This formula expresses the rate of precession of an orbit due to the curvature of spacetime around a massive object, such as the Sun, affecting the motion of nearby bodies.

### **2. Derivation**  
1. **Schwarzschild Metric and Spacetime Curvature:**  
   The Schwarzschild metric, which describes the spacetime surrounding a non-rotating spherical mass, provides the foundation for understanding orbital precession. The equation is:
   \[
   ds^2 = - \left( 1 - \frac{2GM}{c^2 r} \right) c^2 dt^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{2GM}{c^2 r} \right)^{-1} dr^2 + r^2 (d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta d\phi^2)
   \]
   - This describes how spacetime is curved in the vicinity of a massive object, affecting the trajectories of moving bodies (including light).

2. **Equation of Motion:**  
   In the presence of a gravitational field, the motion of a test particle is described by the geodesic equation. For an object moving in an elliptical orbit around a massive object, the path will be curved in such a way that the perihelion of the orbit (the point of closest approach) shifts gradually over time due to spacetime curvature.

3. **Orbital Precession in General Relativity:**  
   By solving the geodesic equation for a two-body system in General Relativity, we can calculate the precession of the orbit. For a body in an elliptical orbit, the shift in the orientation of the orbit (i.e., the precession of the perihelion) is given by the formula:
   \[
   \Delta \phi = \frac{6 \pi G M}{c^2 a (1 - e^2)}
   \]
   - This equation gives the amount by which the orbit precesses per orbit. The factors \( a \) and \( e \) relate to the size and shape of the orbit, while the mass \( M \) and gravitational constant \( G \) determine the strength of the gravitational field.

4. **Relativistic Correction to Newtonian Orbits:**  
   In Newtonian mechanics, the orbit of a planet or star around a central mass is described by an elliptical trajectory with no precession. However, the effects of spacetime curvature in General Relativity cause a small shift in the orientation of the ellipse over time, which is observable as the precession of the orbit.

### **3. Experimental Verification**  
1. **Mercury's Orbit:**  
   One of the most famous tests of General Relativity is the observed precession of the perihelion of Mercury’s orbit around the Sun. Mercury’s orbit deviates slightly from the predictions of Newtonian mechanics, and General Relativity accurately explains this deviation by accounting for the curvature of spacetime.  
   - Observations show that Mercury’s perihelion precesses by about 43 arcseconds per century, which is precisely the amount predicted by the formula derived from General Relativity.

2. **Binary Pulsars:**  
   Another experimental confirmation comes from observations of binary pulsars. These are systems where two neutron stars orbit each other. The orbital precession in these systems has been measured, and the observed precession matches the predictions made by General Relativity.

3. **Gravitational Lensing:**  
   The effects of precession are also closely related to gravitational lensing, where light from a distant object is bent around a massive body. The bending of light can be observed as a shift in the apparent position of the light source, and this phenomenon is also predicted by General Relativity.

   \Delta \phi = \frac{6 \pi \times 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \times 1.989 \times 10^{30}}{(3 \times 10^8)^2 \times 5.79 \times 10^{10} \times (1 - 0.2056^2)}
   \]
   After calculation, the result will give the precession per orbit of Mercury’s orbit around the Sun.
