### **1. Causal Geometry**  
#### **1.1 Phenomenon:**  
- The equation describes the process of Hawking radiation, where quantum fluctuations near the event horizon lead to the spontaneous creation of particle-antiparticle pairs. These pairs are separated by the event horizon, with one particle falling into the black hole and the other escaping as Hawking radiation.
- The phenomenon solves the apparent contradiction between black holes having no visible radiation (according to classical General Relativity) and the need for black holes to emit radiation due to quantum mechanical effects, ensuring consistency with the laws of thermodynamics.

#### **1.2 Theory:**  
- The theory behind Hawking radiation is grounded in **Quantum Field Theory** in **curved spacetime**. In regions of extreme gravitational curvature, such as near the event horizon of a black hole, quantum fluctuations lead to the creation of particle-antiparticle pairs. 
- The **black hole information paradox** arises from this process, as information about the infalling matter seems to be lost when it crosses the event horizon. However, Hawking proposed that the radiation emitted by the black hole carries information about the internal state of the black hole.
- Historically, **Stephen Hawking** (1974) proposed the existence of Hawking radiation, showing that black holes are not completely black but emit radiation due to quantum effects near the event horizon.

#### **1.3 Original Equation:**  
- The original Hawking radiation formula gives the power radiated by a black hole:

\[
P_{\text{Hawking}} = \frac{\hbar c^6}{15360 \pi G^2 M^2}
\]

Where:
- \( P_{\text{Hawking}} \) is the power radiated by the black hole.
- \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant.
- \( c \) is the speed of light.
- \( G \) is the gravitational constant.
- \( M \) is the mass of the black hole.

This equation provides the rate at which a black hole loses mass through Hawking radiation, with smaller black holes radiating more power than larger ones.

#### **1.4 Relativity Equation:**  
- In **Causal Relativity**, we adjust the Hawking radiation formula to account for the **curvature** of the event horizon, the **thickness of the causal boundary**, and potential modifications due to quantum gravitational effects at the boundary. The new equation includes a correction term \( \Delta M \) for the black hole mass, reflecting these effects:

\[
P_{\text{Hawking, causal}} = \frac{\hbar c^6}{15360 \pi G^2 (M + \Delta M)^2}
\]

Where:
- \( \Delta M \) represents a small mass fluctuation due to the curvature and quantum effects at the event horizon.
  
This modification incorporates quantum corrections at the event horizon in the context of **Causal Relativity**, reflecting a more detailed model of the black hole's causal structure.

### **2. Derivation**  

- The derivation of the Hawking radiation equation starts with the **Bogoliubov coefficients** and the **Unruh effect**. These coefficients describe how vacuum states in flat spacetime are mapped to excited states in curved spacetime, leading to the creation of particles.

- The power radiated by the black hole is related to the temperature of the Hawking radiation. The temperature \( T_{\text{Hawking}} \) of the radiation is inversely proportional to the mass of the black hole:

\[
T_{\text{Hawking}} = \frac{\hbar c^3}{8 \pi G M k_B}
\]

- Using the **Stefan-Boltzmann law** for black hole radiation, the power emitted by a black hole is given by:

\[
P_{\text{Hawking}} = A \sigma T_{\text{Hawking}}^4
\]

Where:
- \( A \) is the area of the event horizon.
- \( \sigma \) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.
- \( T_{\text{Hawking}} \) is the temperature.

Substituting \( T_{\text{Hawking}} \) into the equation, we obtain the original formula for the Hawking radiation power:

\[
P_{\text{Hawking}} = \frac{\hbar c^6}{15360 \pi G^2 M^2}
\]

- To adjust for the **curvature** and **boundary thickness**, we add a correction term \( \Delta M \), resulting in the Causal Relativity equation:

\[
P_{\text{Hawking, causal}} = \frac{\hbar c^6}{15360 \pi G^2 (M + \Delta M)^2}
\]

This new equation includes the effects of quantum fluctuations at the black hole's event horizon, adjusting the mass \( M \) to account for the dynamics at the boundary.

### **3. Validation**  

- **Experimental Confirmation:** Direct confirmation of Hawking radiation is challenging due to the extremely weak nature of the radiation for large black holes. However, indirect evidence has been obtained through **analog black hole experiments** in systems such as Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) and in **high-energy astrophysical phenomena**. These experiments provide analogous conditions for observing Hawking-like radiation.
  
- **Simulations:** High-performance simulations of black hole mergers, such as those conducted by the **LIGO** collaboration, indirectly validate Hawking's theory by showing how black holes interact with their surroundings and emit radiation during mergers.

- The inclusion of the curvature correction \( \Delta M \) in **Causal Relativity** is more speculative and would need further verification through quantum gravitational models and detailed simulations of black hole dynamics.

### **4. Sample Problem**  
#### **4.1 Problem Statement:**  
Suppose we have a small black hole with a mass \( M = 10^6 \, \text{kg} \). Calculate the power radiated by the black hole through Hawking radiation, considering a curvature correction \( \Delta M = 10 \, \text{kg} \).

#### **4.2 Solution/Calculation:**  
1. The original Hawking radiation power formula is:

\[
P_{\text{Hawking}} = \frac{\hbar c^6}{15360 \pi G^2 M^2}
\]

Substitute the given mass \( M = 10^6 \, \text{kg} \) into the equation:

\[
P_{\text{Hawking}} = \frac{(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}) (3 \times 10^8)^6}{15360 \pi (6.674 \times 10^{-11})^2 (10^6)^2}
\]

2. Calculate:

\[
P_{\text{Hawking}} = 9.69 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{watts}
\]

3. Now, using the **Causal Relativity equation** with the curvature correction \( \Delta M = 10 \, \text{kg} \):

\[
P_{\text{Hawking, causal}} = \frac{\hbar c^6}{15360 \pi G^2 (M + \Delta M)^2}
\]

Substitute \( M = 10^6 \, \text{kg} \) and \( \Delta M = 10 \, \text{kg} \):

\[
P_{\text{Hawking, causal}} = \frac{(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}) (3 \times 10^8)^6}{15360 \pi (6.674 \times 10^{-11})^2 (10^6 + 10)^2}
\]

4. Calculate:

\[
P_{\text{Hawking, causal}} \approx 9.68 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{watts}
\]

The difference is negligible for such a small \( \Delta M \), but for larger black holes, the curvature correction becomes more significant.
