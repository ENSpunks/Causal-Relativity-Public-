### **1. Causal Geometry**  
#### **1.1 Phenomenon:**  
- The Dirac equation governs the behavior of fermions, accounting for spin and relativity. Here, we explore how these effects manifest through spatial causality.

#### **1.2 Theory:**  
- Paul Dirac formulated this equation to reconcile special relativity with quantum mechanics. In causal relativity, we reinterpret these effects spatially.

#### **1.3 Original Equation:**  
- \( (i\hbar \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu - mc)\psi = 0 \)

#### **1.4 Relativity Equation:**  
- \( (i\hbar \gamma^i \partial_i - mc)\psi(\mathbf{r}) = 0 \)
- \( \gamma^i \) now relates to spatial dimensions within the causal sphere, and time is removed from the derivative.

### **2. Derivation**  

- **Step 1:** Start with the Dirac matrices in 3D space, adjusting for the absence of time.

- **Step 2:** Define the wave function \( \psi(\mathbf{r}) \) in terms of spatial configurations, including spin.

- **Step 3:** Derive the equation by ensuring it satisfies the Klein-Gordon equation in spatial terms to maintain consistency with relativity but now within Alice's causal sphere.

- **Step 4:** Solve for spatial configurations where the wave function can exist, considering how mass and spin interact with the causal geometry.

### **3. Validation**  

- **Validation**: 
  - Predictions for electron behavior in strong fields or near massive objects should align with observed phenomena like fine structure.
  - Simulations or calculations for spin states must match experimental data without invoking time.

- **Limitations**: 
  - The spatial-only approach must still account for effects traditionally explained by time evolution.

### **4. Sample Problem**  
#### **4.1 Problem Statement:**  
- Calculate the spatial distribution of an electron in a hydrogen atom, considering relativistic effects within Alice's causal sphere.

#### **4.2 Solution/Calculation:**  
- Use the modified Dirac equation to describe the spatial wave function, focusing on how spin interacts with the causal geometry.

### **5. AI Prompt**  
- "Simulate the spatial distribution of an electron in a hydrogen atom using the causal relativity version of the Dirac equation. Compare to traditional relativistic quantum mechanics predictions."
