### **1. Causal Geometry**  
#### **1.1 Phenomenon:**  
- **Gravitational Redshift** refers to the change in the frequency (and wavelength) of light due to the presence of a gravitational field. Light traveling away from a massive object, such as a planet or a star, experiences a shift towards longer wavelengths (redshift), which corresponds to a decrease in frequency.
- This phenomenon is a direct consequence of General Relativity, which predicts that time runs slower in stronger gravitational fields. This slowdown affects the frequency of light emitted from a source in a gravitational field, leading to gravitational redshift.
- The general equation for gravitational redshift in the context of light traveling away from a massive object is given by the following formula, which describes how the wavelength of light is stretched as it escapes the gravitational influence of a mass.

#### **1.2 Theory:**  
- **General Relativity:** Developed by Albert Einstein, General Relativity explains the relationship between matter, energy, and the curvature of spacetime. It suggests that mass and energy bend the fabric of spacetime, and the influence of gravity can affect both time and light propagation.  
- **Gravitational Redshift** is one of the key predictions of General Relativity, confirmed by multiple experimental observations. It arises from the fact that light emitted in a strong gravitational field is redshifted when observed in a weaker gravitational field. This effect is predicted by the Schwarzschild metric, which describes the spacetime around a non-rotating, spherically symmetric mass.

#### **1.3 Original Equation:**  
The original equation for gravitational redshift is:
\[
z = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{2GM}{c^2 r}}} - 1
\]
Where:
- \( z \): The gravitational redshift, which is the fractional change in frequency (or wavelength) as the light escapes the gravitational field.
- \( G \): The gravitational constant.
- \( M \): The mass of the object causing the gravitational field (e.g., a star or planet).
- \( c \): The speed of light.
- \( r \): The radial distance from the center of the massive object (the source of gravity).

This formula gives the amount of redshift for light emitted from a source at a distance \( r \) from a massive object, based on the object's mass \( M \) and the gravitational constant.

#### **1.4 Gravitational Redshift Equation (Alternate Form):**  
A different expression for the gravitational redshift relates it to the change in length:
\[
\Delta L' = \Delta L \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{2GM}{c^2 r}}} \right)
\]
Where:
- \( \Delta L' \): The wavelength of light observed at a distance \( r \) from the massive object.
- \( \Delta L \): The original wavelength of light emitted from the source.
- This expression shows how the wavelength of light changes due to gravitational effects.

### **2. Derivation**  
1. **Schwarzschild Metric:**  
   The Schwarzschild solution to Einstein's field equations describes the spacetime surrounding a spherically symmetric mass. This metric is crucial for understanding the effects of gravity on time and light. It can be written as:
   \[
   ds^2 = - \left( 1 - \frac{2GM}{c^2 r} \right) c^2 dt^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{2GM}{c^2 r} \right)^{-1} dr^2 + r^2 (d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta d\phi^2)
   \]
   - This describes how the spacetime around a mass \( M \) is curved by gravity.

2. **Gravitational Time Dilation:**  
   One of the key results of the Schwarzschild metric is that time passes more slowly in a stronger gravitational field. For an observer at a radial distance \( r \) from a mass, the time dilation factor is given by:
   \[
   \frac{d\tau}{dt} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{2GM}{c^2 r}}
   \]
   - Where \( d\tau \) is the proper time measured by an observer near the mass, and \( dt \) is the coordinate time measured by an observer far away from the mass.
   
3. **Relating Time Dilation to Light:**  
   The energy of a photon, and thus its frequency, is related to the time intervals between its emission and detection. Due to the time dilation effects predicted by General Relativity, light emitted from a source near a massive object will be observed at a lower frequency (redshifted) when it reaches an observer farther away from the source.

4. **Gravitational Redshift Formula:**  
   The gravitational redshift can be derived from the time dilation formula. Since the frequency of light is inversely proportional to the time interval between successive wave crests, the redshift \( z \) can be written as:
   \[
   z = \frac{\nu_{\text{observed}}}{\nu_{\text{emitted}}} - 1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{2GM}{c^2 r}}} - 1
   \]
   - Here, \( \nu_{\text{observed}} \) is the frequency observed by an observer at a distance \( r \), and \( \nu_{\text{emitted}} \) is the frequency of light emitted from the source.

5. **Alternate Form for Wavelength Change:**  
   Alternatively, the redshift can be expressed as a change in the wavelength of light:
   \[
   \Delta L' = \Delta L \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{2GM}{c^2 r}}} \right)
   \]
   - This shows that the wavelength of light is stretched as it moves away from the gravitational source, leading to a shift towards longer wavelengths.

### **3. Experimental Verification**  
- **Early Confirmation:**  
   - The first experimental confirmation of gravitational redshift came from the observation of light from the Sun. Using the technology available at the time, the shift in the light emitted by atoms in the Sun's atmosphere was found to be consistent with the predictions of General Relativity.
  
- **Modern Observations:**  
   - Gravitational redshift has been observed in numerous astrophysical contexts. For example, the redshift of light from galaxies, stars, and even black holes is attributed to the gravitational influence of these massive objects.  
   - Observations of white dwarf stars and neutron stars have also provided evidence for gravitational redshift. These objects have extremely strong gravitational fields, and their light exhibits measurable redshift effects.

### **4. Sample Problem**  
#### **4.1 Problem Statement:**  
A star with a mass of \( M = 2 \times 10^{30} \, \text{kg} \) (about the mass of the Sun) emits light at a wavelength of \( 500 \, \text{nm} \) at its surface. Calculate the wavelength of the light as observed by an observer located at a distance \( r = 10 \, \text{km} \) from the surface of the star.

#### **4.2 Solution/Calculation:**  
1. **Given:**  
   - Mass of the star, \( M = 2 \times 10^{30} \, \text{kg} \)  
   - Original wavelength, \( \Delta L = 500 \, \text{nm} \)  
   - Distance from the star, \( r = 10 \, \text{km} = 10^4 \, \text{m} \)  
   - Gravitational constant, \( G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \text{kg}^{-1} \text{s}^{-2} \)  
   - Speed of light, \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)

2. **Gravitational Redshift Equation:**  
   Use the formula for the gravitational redshift:
   \[
   \Delta L' = \Delta L \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{2GM}{c^2 r}}} \right)
   \]
   
3. **Substitute Values:**  
   \[
   \Delta L' = 500 \, \text{nm} \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{2 \times 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \times 2 \times 10^{30}}{(3 \times 10^8)^2 \times 10^4}}} \right)
   \]
   
4. **Result:**  
   After calculating, the final value of \( \Delta L' \) will give the wavelength of the light observed by the observer at the specified distance. This shows how gravitational fields stretch the wavelength of light, demonstrating the gravitational redshift effect.
