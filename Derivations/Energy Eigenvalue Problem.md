### **t = 0**  
**Causal Geometry:** In the causal relativity framework, the energy eigenvalue problem is framed within the context of quantum mechanics, where the focus is on space itself, devoid of the notion of spacetime. The system’s energy is derived from the causal structure of space, influencing how quantum states evolve. There is no curvature of spacetime as per the old model; instead, the spatial properties affect the evolution of the wave function. The relationship between the quantum state and its energy eigenvalue is governed by a modified Hamiltonian that takes into account the interaction of the system with its surrounding space.  
**Phenomenon:** The energy eigenvalue problem investigates the relationship between a quantum system’s wave function and its energy. For a given system described by a Hamiltonian, the problem involves finding the eigenvalues (energy levels) and the corresponding eigenfunctions (quantum states). In causal relativity, this relationship is modified by the influence of space itself, which alters how energy is distributed within the system.  
**Theory:** The theory of causal relativity modifies quantum mechanics by introducing the idea that quantum systems are affected by the underlying structure of space. In this framework, energy eigenvalues are influenced by the space's causal properties, which modify the Hamiltonian governing the system’s evolution. This shift moves away from the old model of spacetime curvature and focuses solely on the geometric properties of space.  
**Original Equation:**  
\[
\hat{H} \psi(x) = E \psi(x)
\]
This is the standard energy eigenvalue equation in quantum mechanics, where \( \hat{H} \) is the Hamiltonian operator, \( \psi(x) \) is the wave function, and \( E \) is the energy eigenvalue.

### **1. Causal Geometry**  
#### **1.1 Phenomenon:**  
The energy eigenvalue problem investigates how quantum systems with specific Hamiltonians relate to their energy states. In the traditional quantum mechanical approach, the system’s energy is obtained by solving the eigenvalue problem for the Hamiltonian operator. However, in the causal relativity framework, the space in which the system resides directly impacts the energy eigenvalue, with space itself influencing the evolution of the quantum state.

In this modified framework, the Hamiltonian is adjusted to reflect the causal properties of space. This leads to a modified energy eigenvalue equation that describes the quantum system in terms of its interaction with the space it occupies, moving beyond the confines of spacetime curvature as described in the classical relativity framework.

#### **1.2 Theory:**  
In traditional quantum mechanics, the energy eigenvalue problem is solved by applying the Hamiltonian operator to the quantum state \( \psi(x) \). The resulting equation:
\[
\hat{H} \psi(x) = E \psi(x)
\]
describes how the quantum system behaves, where the Hamiltonian consists of terms representing the system’s kinetic and potential energies.

The theory of causal relativity modifies this equation by introducing the idea that the quantum system interacts with the space it occupies. Rather than spacetime curvature affecting the system, it is the causal geometry of space that influences the system's energy and the corresponding wave function. This leads to a modified Hamiltonian, incorporating both the physical forces and the causal properties of the space itself.

#### **1.3 Original Equation:**  
The original energy eigenvalue problem in quantum mechanics is given by the equation:
\[
\hat{H} \psi(x) = E \psi(x)
\]
This equation represents the quantum system’s total energy as an eigenvalue \( E \), with \( \hat{H} \) being the Hamiltonian operator and \( \psi(x) \) the quantum wave function.

#### **1.4 Causal Relativity Equation:**  
In the causal relativity framework, the Hamiltonian is modified to reflect the causal structure of space. The space in which the system resides influences the energy eigenvalues and the evolution of the wave function. The causal Hamiltonian is given by:
\[
\hat{H}_{\text{causal}} \psi(\mathbf{r}) = E_{\text{causal}} \psi(\mathbf{r})
\]
where the Hamiltonian \( \hat{H}_{\text{causal}} \) is:
\[
\hat{H}_{\text{causal}} = \frac{-\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 x^2 + \lambda x \cos(kx)
\]
Here, the potential term \( \lambda x \cos(kx) \) is modified to reflect the causal influence of the surrounding space. The energy eigenvalue \( E_{\text{causal}} \) now incorporates both the physical potential and the space's causal properties, dictating how the quantum state evolves within this context.

### **2. Derivation**  

- **Step 1:** Start with the traditional energy eigenvalue problem in quantum mechanics:
\[
\hat{H} \psi(x) = E \psi(x)
\]
where \( \hat{H} \) is the Hamiltonian and \( \psi(x) \) is the wave function.  

- **Step 2:** Introduce the causal relativity framework by modifying the Hamiltonian to include the causal structure of space. This leads to the new form of the Hamiltonian:
\[
\hat{H}_{\text{causal}} = \frac{-\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 x^2 + \lambda x \cos(kx)
\]

- **Step 3:** Solve the modified eigenvalue equation for \( \hat{H}_{\text{causal}} \). The eigenvalues \( E_{\text{causal}} \) will now include contributions from both the system’s potential energy and the space’s causal geometry.

- **Step 4:** Interpret the solutions in terms of the energy eigenvalues and corresponding wave functions. These solutions will reflect the influence of the surrounding space on the quantum state.

### **3. Validation**  

- The equation can be validated through systems where energy eigenvalue problems are well understood, such as the harmonic oscillator. By comparing the traditional solutions with the causal relativity solutions, one can observe how the introduction of causal space influences the energy eigenvalues.

  - Experimental validation can be drawn from quantum systems that exhibit behaviors influenced by space itself, such as those near gravitational fields or other spatial effects that could modify energy levels.
  
  - Limitations might arise in extremely high-energy or highly curved regions of space, where causal effects become more pronounced, requiring more complex models to fully describe the energy eigenvalue problem.

### **4. Sample Problem**  
#### **4.1 Problem Statement:**  
Consider a quantum particle in a harmonic potential that is subject to a driving force proportional to \( \lambda x \cos(kx) \). The particle exists in a space with a non-trivial causal structure that influences its energy. Calculate the energy eigenvalues and wave functions using the modified Hamiltonian under the causal relativity framework.

Given:
- Mass \( m \), frequency \( \omega \), and potential \( \lambda x \cos(kx) \).
- The modified causal Hamiltonian \( \hat{H}_{\text{causal}} \).

#### **4.2 Solution/Calculation:**  
- Solve the energy eigenvalue equation:
\[
\hat{H}_{\text{causal}} \psi(x) = E_{\text{causal}} \psi(x)
\]
using the modified Hamiltonian.  
- Calculate the energy eigenvalues \( E_{\text{causal}} \) and the corresponding eigenfunctions \( \psi(x) \).  
- Compare these results to the traditional quantum harmonic oscillator to determine the effect of the space’s causal geometry on the system’s energy.
