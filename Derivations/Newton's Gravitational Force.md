**Causal Geometry:** Mass  
**Phenomenon:** Newton's Gravitational Force  
**Theory:** Classical Mechanics  
**Original Equation:** \( F = \frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2} \)

To redefine ( K ) in the context of Causal Relativity as a time-independent quantity, let's focus on its spatial implications. Here's how you might do it:

Redefinition of ( K ):

( K ): Represents the Spatial Curvature Influence due to mass ( M ). It quantifies how much space is "curved" or influenced by the presence of mass at a distance ( r ). This curvature dictates the spatial geometry around the mass, influencing how other objects or light would behave within this curvature, without explicit reference to temporal dynamics.

Interpretation: Instead of acceleration, ( K ) here describes a static spatial property, a measure of how space itself is configured due to the mass's presence. It reflects the gravitational influence as a geometric feature of space.

Propagation: The effect of this curvature propagates outward at the speed of light ( c ), defining how far the influence of the mass extends in space, but this is about spatial causality rather than temporal evolution.

Inverse Proportionality: The strength of this curvature decreases with distance from the mass, illustrating how gravity's influence diminishes spatially, not temporally.

### **1. Causal Geometry**  
#### **1.1 Phenomenon:**  
- Newton's Gravitational Force describes the attractive force that acts between two masses due to gravity.  
- This equation explains phenomena such as planetary orbits, tidal forces, and the behavior of objects in gravitational fields.  

#### **1.2 Theory:**  
- Classical mechanics defines gravity as a force proportional to the product of two masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.  
- Developed by Isaac Newton in 1687, this theory provided a quantitative framework for understanding celestial mechanics and terrestrial gravity.  

#### **1.3 Original Equation:**  
\[ F = \frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2} \]  
- \( F \): Gravitational force (\( N \))  
- \( G \): Gravitational constant (\( 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{Nm}^2/\text{kg}^2 \))  
- \( m_1, m_2 \): Masses of the objects (\( kg \))  
- \( r \): Distance between the objects' centers (\( m \))  

#### **1.4 Relativity Equation:**  
\[ K = \frac{GM}{r^2} \]  
- \( K \): Gravitational field strength or acceleration due to gravity (\( m/s^2 \))  
- \( M \): Mass of the primary object creating the gravitational field (\( kg \))

### **2. Derivation**  
- Begin with Newton's law of gravitation:  
  \[ F = \frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2} \]  
- Define \( K \) as the gravitational field strength:  
  \[ K = \frac{F}{m_2} \]  
- Substitute \( F \):  
  \[ K = \frac{\frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2}}{m_2} \]  
- Simplify:  
  \[ K = \frac{GM}{r^2} \]  
- This expresses the gravitational influence of a mass \( M \) as a field strength, independent of the second mass.

### **3. Validation**  
- **Experimental Validation:**  
  - Cavendish experiment (1798) measured \( G \), confirming the equation quantitatively.  
- **Astronomical Evidence:**  
  - Accurate predictions of planetary orbits (e.g., Earth's orbit around the Sun).  
  - Observations of tidal forces and satellite trajectories.  
- **Known Limitations:**  
  - Fails to account for relativistic effects near massive objects (e.g., black holes).  
  - Superseded by Einstein's General Relativity in extreme conditions.

### **4. Sample Problem**  
#### **4.1 Problem Statement:**  
Calculate the gravitational force between Earth (\( M = 5.97 \times 10^{24} \, kg \)) and a satellite of mass \( 1,000 \, kg \), located at a distance of \( 6,700,000 \, m \) from Earth's center.  

#### **4.2 Solution/Calculation:**  
1. **Given:**  
   - \( G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{Nm}^2/\text{kg}^2 \)  
   - \( M = 5.97 \times 10^{24} \, kg \)  
   - \( m = 1,000 \, kg \)  
   - \( r = 6,700,000 \, m \)  

2. **Substitute values into the equation:**  
   \[ F = \frac{GMm}{r^2} \]  
   \[ F = \frac{(6.674 \times 10^{-11})(5.97 \times 10^{24})(1,000)}{(6,700,000)^2} \]  

3. **Simplify:**  
   \[ F = \frac{3.986 \times 10^{14}}{4.489 \times 10^{13}} \]  
   \[ F = 8.88 \, \text{kN} \]  

4. **Result:**  
   The gravitational force is **8.88 kN**.
