### **1. Causal Geometry**  
#### **1.1 Phenomenon:**  
- Dark matter is an invisible and unknown form of matter that does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it detectable only through its gravitational effects. At the time of the Big Bang, dark matter played a crucial role in the formation of the first galaxies and large-scale structures. Its interaction with ordinary matter through gravity contributed significantly to the early growth of structure in the universe.
- The **gravitational lensing** effects caused by dark matter halos are a primary means of detecting dark matter indirectly. Additionally, dark matter's quantum nature and interactions can be explored in the context of **Causal Relativity**, where its density is influenced by the expanding causal boundaries of the universe.

#### **1.2 Theory:**  
- In the **standard model of cosmology**, dark matter is often treated as a form of cold matter, interacting only through gravity and possibly weak forces, making it the dominant form of matter in the universe today. The **Lambda-CDM model** is the current paradigm for explaining the role of dark matter in cosmology, where it forms halos around galaxies and clusters.
- In **Causal Relativity**, we consider how quantum fluctuations in the causal region of the universe, especially at very early times, may influence dark matter's distribution. The expansion of the universe alters how dark matter clusters and interacts within these causal boundaries.
- Dark matter, in this framework, is also affected by the **causal horizon** of the universe, which limits the regions of space that could have influenced each other in a causal manner due to the finite speed of light.

#### **1.3 Original Equation:**  
- In standard cosmology, the energy density of dark matter at a given time \( t \) is often described by the equation:

\[
\rho_{\text{DM}}(t) = \frac{C H(t)^2}{8 \pi G}
\]

Where:
- \( \rho_{\text{DM}}(t) \) is the dark matter density at time \( t \).
- \( H(t) \) is the Hubble parameter at time \( t \).
- \( C \) is a constant that depends on the properties of dark matter.
- \( G \) is the gravitational constant.

This equation provides an approximation of dark matter's density in terms of the Hubble expansion rate at a given epoch.

#### **1.4 Relativity Equation:**  
- The Causal Relativity framework introduces modifications due to the **quantum fluctuations** and **causal interactions** that influence dark matter's distribution. These fluctuations are most significant in the early universe, during the time of inflation and the formation of the first structures.
- The modified equation for dark matter density in Causal Relativity is:

\[
\rho_{\text{DM, causal}}(t) = \frac{C H(t)^2}{8 \pi G} \left( 1 + \Delta \rho_{\text{DM}} \right)
\]

Where:
- \( \Delta \rho_{\text{DM}} \) represents the quantum corrections to the dark matter density due to causal effects at the time of the Big Bang, including interactions within causal regions and quantum fluctuations.

### **2. Derivation**  

- To derive the equation for dark matter density, we start with the **Friedmann equations** governing the expansion of the universe:

\[
H^2 = \frac{8 \pi G}{3} \left( \rho_{\text{DM}} + \rho_{\text{DE}} + \rho_{\text{rad}} \right)
\]

Where:
- \( H \) is the Hubble parameter, which dictates the rate of expansion of the universe.
- \( \rho_{\text{DM}} \) is the dark matter density.
- \( \rho_{\text{DE}} \) is the dark energy density.
- \( \rho_{\text{rad}} \) is the radiation density.

- At early times, the contribution of radiation and dark energy is relatively small, so dark matter dominates the energy budget of the universe. The equation for the dark matter density becomes:

\[
H^2 = \frac{8 \pi G}{3} \rho_{\text{DM}}
\]

From this, we can solve for \( \rho_{\text{DM}} \):

\[
\rho_{\text{DM}} = \frac{3 H^2}{8 \pi G}
\]

- Introducing the **Causal Relativity** correction, we account for quantum fluctuations within causal regions of the universe. These fluctuations are assumed to be small, but they influence the distribution of dark matter. The modified equation becomes:

\[
\rho_{\text{DM, causal}}(t) = \frac{C H(t)^2}{8 \pi G} \left( 1 + \Delta \rho_{\text{DM}} \right)
\]

This equation incorporates the effects of quantum fluctuations, resulting in a small but significant modification of the dark matter density compared to the classical model.

### **3. Validation**  

- **Experimental Confirmation:** Direct evidence for dark matter is primarily obtained through gravitational lensing, galaxy rotation curves, and the cosmic microwave background (CMB). These observations suggest that dark matter has a significant gravitational influence on the structure and evolution of the universe.
- **Observational Evidence:** Simulations of large-scale structure formation in the universe also provide indirect evidence for the presence of dark matter. These simulations predict the existence of **dark matter halos** around galaxies, which are consistent with observations of galaxy rotation curves.
- The inclusion of **Causal Relativity** corrections is still theoretical, and its effects on dark matter density are subject to future observational tests through improvements in cosmological simulations, quantum gravity studies, and the potential detection of quantum fluctuations in the early universe.

### **4. Sample Problem**  
#### **4.1 Problem Statement:**  
Given a Hubble parameter at time \( t = 0 \) of \( H_0 = 70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc} \) and a constant \( C = 0.3 \), calculate the dark matter density at the time of the Big Bang, including a causal correction \( \Delta \rho_{\text{DM}} = 0.05 \).

#### **4.2 Solution/Calculation:**  
1. Convert the Hubble constant \( H_0 \) into SI units:

\[
H_0 = 70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc} = 2.29 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{s}^{-1}
\]

2. Use the equation for dark matter density:

\[
\rho_{\text{DM}} = \frac{3 H_0^2}{8 \pi G}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\rho_{\text{DM}} = \frac{3 (2.29 \times 10^{-18})^2}{8 \pi (6.674 \times 10^{-11})}
\]

3. Calculate the dark matter density:

\[
\rho_{\text{DM}} \approx 9.28 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg/m}^3
\]

4. Apply the **Causal Relativity correction**:

\[
\rho_{\text{DM, causal}}(t) = 9.28 \times 10^{-27} \left( 1 + 0.05 \right) \, \text{kg/m}^3
\]

5. Calculate the corrected dark matter density:

\[
\rho_{\text{DM, causal}}(t) \approx 9.74 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg/m}^3
\]

Thus, the dark matter density at the time of the Big Bang with the Causal Relativity correction is approximately \( 9.74 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg/m}^3 \).
