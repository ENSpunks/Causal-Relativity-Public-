**Causal Geometry:**  
The equation \( E_{\text{out}} = E_{\text{in}} \left( \frac{r_s}{r} \right) \) describes how the energy of light changes when it moves through a gravitational field, as predicted by General Relativity. In this equation, \( E_{\text{in}} \) is the energy of light at a distance \( r \) from a massive object, and \( E_{\text{out}} \) is the energy of light at a distance \( r_s \) (the Schwarzschild radius, or the radius of the event horizon of a black hole). This equation illustrates how light, or any form of electromagnetic radiation, is affected by the curvature of spacetime caused by gravity, leading to redshift or blueshift depending on the direction of light propagation.

**Phenomenon:**  
The phenomenon described by this equation is the gravitational redshift or blueshift of light. As light moves away from a massive object (such as a star or black hole), its energy decreases, causing a redshift. Conversely, as light moves toward a massive object, its energy increases, causing a blueshift. The change in energy is a result of the warping of spacetime due to gravity, an effect first described by Einstein's theory of General Relativity.

**Theory:**  
General Relativity, developed by Albert Einstein in 1915, explains gravity not as a force but as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. The energy of light is not constant as it moves through this curved spacetime; instead, it changes based on the gravitational influence of massive objects. This effect is a direct consequence of the equivalence principle, which asserts that the laws of physics are the same in any locally inertial frame of reference. Light moving through a gravitational field experiences a change in energy due to the curvature of spacetime.

**Original Equation:**  
The original equation describing the energy change of light in a gravitational field is:
\[
E_{\text{out}} = E_{\text{in}} \left( \frac{r_s}{r} \right)
\]
where:
- \( E_{\text{out}} \) is the energy of light at a distance \( r_s \) from the massive object (Schwarzschild radius or event horizon),
- \( E_{\text{in}} \) is the energy of light at a distance \( r \) from the massive object,
- \( r \) is the initial radial distance from the massive object,
- \( r_s \) is the Schwarzschild radius, the distance at which the escape velocity equals the speed of light, often associated with the event horizon of a black hole.

### **1. Causal Geometry**  
#### **1.1 Phenomenon:**  
- **Gravitational Redshift and Blueshift:** The equation describes how the energy of light is affected by gravity. If light is emitted near a massive object and travels outward, its energy decreases due to the gravitational potential, resulting in a redshift. On the other hand, if light is moving towards a massive object, its energy increases, resulting in a blueshift. This phenomenon occurs because gravity distorts spacetime, which in turn affects the frequency and wavelength of light as it moves through the field.

- **What the Equation Solves:** The equation solves the problem of understanding how the energy of light is altered as it passes through a gravitational field. It quantifies the change in energy based on the distance from a massive object and helps to explain the observed phenomena such as gravitational redshift around stars and black holes.

#### **1.2 Theory:**  
- **General Relativity:** According to General Relativity, mass and energy warp spacetime, and this curvature affects the paths and properties of light traveling through it. The energy of light in a gravitational field is dependent on the strength of this curvature, which is related to the gravitational potential. The equation \( E_{\text{out}} = E_{\text{in}} \left( \frac{r_s}{r} \right) \) provides a simple relationship for how the energy of light changes due to this curvature.

- **Redshift in Gravitational Fields:** The concept of gravitational redshift was first predicted by Einstein and later confirmed through observation. The equation shows that the energy of light decreases as it escapes from a massive object's gravitational influence, causing a shift to longer wavelengths (redshift). This shift can be observed as the light from distant stars or galaxies shows a redshift when observed from Earth.

- **Equivalence Principle and Light:** The equivalence principle in General Relativity states that locally, gravitational effects cannot be distinguished from acceleration. This principle is essential in understanding why light experiences a change in energy due to gravity: light moving through a gravitational field effectively experiences the curvature of spacetime, just as an object would experience a force due to acceleration.

#### **1.3 Original Equation:**  
The original equation for the energy of light in a gravitational field is:
\[
E_{\text{out}} = E_{\text{in}} \left( \frac{r_s}{r} \right)
\]
This equation expresses how the energy of light decreases as it moves away from a massive object, with the degree of decrease depending on the radial distance from the object. The Schwarzschild radius, \( r_s \), represents the distance from a black hole’s center, beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape.

#### **1.4 Relativity Equation:**  
- **Energy Transformation in Gravitational Fields:** The equation shows that the energy of light is inversely proportional to the distance from the center of the massive object (as measured in the Schwarzschild coordinate system). When light is emitted from a source near a massive object, the gravitational field causes a redshift, reducing the energy as the light moves outward. This relationship is significant in astrophysical contexts, particularly in the study of black holes, neutron stars, and other compact objects.

- **Black Holes and Event Horizons:** The equation is also relevant for understanding the behavior of light near black holes. At the Schwarzschild radius (the event horizon), the escape velocity is equal to the speed of light. This causes the energy of light to approach zero at the event horizon, leading to the phenomenon where light cannot escape the black hole, a key characteristic of black holes.

### **2. Derivation**  
The energy of light in a gravitational field is derived from the metric of spacetime and the gravitational potential. To understand the energy change, we must use the concept of gravitational redshift in the context of General Relativity.

1. **Gravitational Potential:**  
   The gravitational potential at a distance \( r \) from a massive object is related to the Schwarzschild radius \( r_s \) by the equation:
   \[
   \Phi(r) = - \frac{GM}{r}
   \]
   where \( G \) is the gravitational constant, \( M \) is the mass of the object, and \( r \) is the radial distance from the object.

2. **Energy of Light:**  
   Light in a gravitational field experiences a shift in energy due to the change in the gravitational potential. The frequency of light \( \nu \) is related to its energy by the equation:
   \[
   E = h\nu
   \]
   where \( h \) is Planck’s constant and \( \nu \) is the frequency of the light.

3. **Redshift in Gravitational Fields:**  
   The change in the frequency of light due to gravity is expressed by the formula:
   \[
   \frac{\nu_{\text{out}}}{\nu_{\text{in}}} = \sqrt{\frac{g_{\text{in}}}{g_{\text{out}}}} = \sqrt{\frac{r_s}{r}}
   \]
   where \( g_{\text{in}} \) and \( g_{\text{out}} \) are the gravitational accelerations at distances \( r \) and \( r_s \), respectively.

4. **Energy Transformation:**  
   Since energy is proportional to frequency, the energy of light at a distance \( r \) from the object is related to its energy at a distance \( r_s \) by:
   \[
   E_{\text{out}} = E_{\text{in}} \left( \frac{r_s}{r} \right)
   \]

### **3. Validation**  
The equation \( E_{\text{out}} = E_{\text{in}} \left( \frac{r_s}{r} \right) \) has been validated through both theoretical predictions and experimental observations:

1. **Gravitational Redshift Observations:**  
   The gravitational redshift of light has been observed in many astronomical contexts. For instance, light emitted from the surface of a white dwarf or the event horizon of a black hole shows a redshift that can be explained by the equation. In particular, the redshift of light from the Sun has been measured and found to be consistent with the predictions of General Relativity.

2. **Black Hole Observations:**  
   The energy transformation of light near black holes is a key area of study. Observations of X-rays and other electromagnetic radiation from black holes and neutron stars show the gravitational effects predicted by this equation, such as the redshift of light near the event horizon.

3. **Cosmological Observations:**  
   The equation also helps explain the cosmological redshift observed in light from distant galaxies. As light travels through the expanding universe, it passes through regions of varying gravitational influence, and its energy is affected by these fields.

   E_{\text{out}} = E_{\text{in}} \left( \frac{r_s}{r} \right)
   \]
   \[
   E_{\text{out}} = 10^3 \times \left( \frac{3 \times 10^5}{10^8} \right)
   \]
   \[
   E_{\text{out}} = 10^3 \times 3 \times 10^{-3}
   \]
   \[
   E_{\text{out}} = 3 \, \text{J}
   \]

3. **Final Result:**  
   The energy of the photon at the Schwarzschild radius is \( 3 \, \text{J} \).
