### **t = 0**  
**Causal Geometry:** In the causal relativity framework, the concept of potential energy is altered by the causal properties of space. A spatial oscillatory potential, such as \( \lambda x \cos(kx) \), is influenced not only by the traditional quantum mechanics principles but also by the inherent causal geometry of the space itself. This leads to a new interpretation of how the system evolves within the spatial domain, where the space's causal structure introduces modifications to the potential that affects quantum state dynamics.  
**Phenomenon:** The spatial oscillatory potential arises from interactions within a periodic potential field, which in quantum mechanics can influence particle behavior by modifying the system’s energy. The key feature of this potential is its periodic nature, which causes oscillations that affect the particle’s motion, leading to discrete energy levels and wave functions that respond to the spatial periodicity.  
**Theory:** In traditional quantum mechanics, the spatial oscillatory potential \( \lambda x \cos(kx) \) describes a system where the potential energy varies periodically in space. In the causal relativity framework, this potential is further modified by the space’s causal structure, impacting how particles experience the oscillations. This framework suggests that the very nature of space itself influences how the quantum state responds to this potential, affecting energy quantization and wave function evolution.  
**Original Equation:**  
\[
V(x) = \lambda x \cos(kx)
\]
This equation represents a spatial oscillatory potential where \( \lambda \) is the potential strength, and \( k \) is the wave number that determines the frequency of oscillations in space.

### **1. Causal Geometry**  
#### **1.1 Phenomenon:**  
The phenomenon of spatial oscillations in a potential is a well-known feature of quantum systems that experience periodic forces. In standard quantum mechanics, a particle in such a potential will exhibit quantized energy levels, with the wave function taking on a sinusoidal form that mirrors the periodicity of the potential. The energy eigenvalues for this system depend on the particle’s interaction with the oscillatory potential.

In causal relativity, the space itself is modified by the inherent causal geometry, which can affect the behavior of particles in this potential. The oscillations of the potential are no longer only a result of the traditional external force but are also influenced by the causal properties of space, which could lead to changes in how energy levels are quantized or how wave functions evolve.

#### **1.2 Theory:**  
Traditional quantum mechanics views the spatial oscillatory potential as a function that influences the potential energy of a particle. This is expressed as:
\[
V(x) = \lambda x \cos(kx)
\]
where \( \lambda \) is the potential strength, and \( k \) is related to the wavelength of the oscillations. The resulting quantum mechanical wave equation is solved to determine the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions.

In causal relativity, space is not just a passive backdrop but an active participant in the system’s behavior. The oscillatory potential is thus not just determined by external forces but is influenced by the space itself, leading to modifications in the wave functions and energy quantization. The influence of space’s causal geometry alters the periodicity and intensity of the oscillations in the potential, affecting the overall dynamics of the quantum system.

#### **1.3 Original Equation:**  
The original form of the spatial oscillatory potential is given by:
\[
V(x) = \lambda x \cos(kx)
\]
This equation models a one-dimensional potential where the particle’s position \( x \) influences the oscillatory behavior. The periodicity of the potential is controlled by the wave number \( k \), and the strength of the potential is controlled by \( \lambda \).

#### **1.4 Causal Relativity Equation:**  
In the causal relativity framework, the oscillatory potential is modified by the causal structure of space. The new potential is given by:
\[
V_{\text{causal}}(x) = \lambda x \cos(kx)
\]
where the causal geometry of space introduces modifications to the oscillations, influencing how the quantum system behaves. The causal effects can alter the wave function’s symmetry, the energy eigenvalues, and the particle’s response to the potential. The space’s causal properties may lead to new, modified solutions to the Schrödinger equation and altered quantization of energy levels.

### **2. Derivation**  

- **Step 1:** Start with the standard Schrödinger equation for a particle in a potential \( V(x) \):
\[
i\hbar \frac{\partial \psi(x,t)}{\partial t} = \hat{H} \psi(x,t)
\]
where \( \hat{H} \) is the Hamiltonian operator, and \( \psi(x,t) \) is the time-dependent wave function.

- **Step 2:** Substitute the spatial oscillatory potential \( V(x) = \lambda x \cos(kx) \) into the Hamiltonian:
\[
\hat{H} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + V(x) = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + \lambda x \cos(kx)
\]

- **Step 3:** Solve the time-independent Schrödinger equation:
\[
\hat{H} \psi(x) = E \psi(x)
\]
This will give the energy eigenvalues and corresponding wave functions for a particle subject to the spatial oscillatory potential.

- **Step 4:** Apply the causal relativity framework by considering the influence of space’s causal geometry on the potential. Modify the potential to \( V_{\text{causal}}(x) = \lambda x \cos(kx) \), and solve the Schrödinger equation again to determine the modified energy eigenvalues and wave functions.

- **Step 5:** Analyze the results, comparing the energy eigenvalues and wave functions in the causal relativity framework to those obtained from standard quantum mechanics. Investigate how the modified potential alters the quantization of energy and the behavior of the particle in the oscillatory potential.

### **3. Validation**  

- **Experimental Validation:**  
  The modified spatial oscillatory potential in causal relativity can be validated by comparing predictions to experimental systems that exhibit periodic potentials. For example, particles in optical lattices or systems with periodic boundary conditions could be used to validate how the causal geometry affects the particle’s behavior.

- **Simulations and Observations:**  
  Numerical simulations could be used to model quantum systems in oscillatory potentials under causal relativity and compare the outcomes to traditional quantum mechanics. Changes in energy levels, wave functions, and particle dynamics due to the causal structure of space can be observed and compared to theoretical predictions.
