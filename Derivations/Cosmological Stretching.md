\]

### **1. Causal Geometry**  
#### **1.1 Phenomenon:**  
- Cosmological stretching refers to the expansion of the universe, where distances between objects (such as galaxies) increase over time due to the stretching of spacetime itself.  
- This phenomenon is observed as the redshift of light from distant galaxies and is a key feature in the current understanding of the universe's evolution. The metric described in this equation models the spacetime geometry of an expanding universe.  
- The equation describes the general form of spacetime used in cosmology, incorporating the scale factor \( a(t) \) which accounts for the dynamic expansion or contraction of the universe.

#### **1.2 Theory:**  
- **General Relativity:** Einstein's theory of General Relativity provides a framework for understanding gravity as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy.  
- The cosmological metric described here is a solution to Einstein's field equations, which describe how the presence of matter and energy influence the curvature of spacetime. The model described is the Robertson-Walker metric, which is widely used in cosmology to represent a homogeneous and isotropic universe.  
- The function \( a(t) \) represents the scale factor, which determines how distances in the universe change as a function of time. The term \( k \) represents the spatial curvature, which can take values -1 (open universe), 0 (flat universe), or +1 (closed universe).

#### **1.3 Original Equation:**  
The original equation that governs cosmological stretching is the metric for spacetime in a general relativistic universe, given by:
\[
ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2 + a(t)^2 \left( \frac{dr^2}{1 - k r^2} + r^2 (d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta d\phi^2) \right)
\]
- \( ds^2 \): The spacetime interval between events.  
- \( c \): The speed of light.  
- \( t \): Time coordinate.  
- \( a(t) \): The scale factor, describing the expansion of the universe.  
- \( k \): The curvature constant (\( k = 0 \) for a flat universe, \( k = +1 \) for a closed universe, \( k = -1 \) for an open universe).  
- \( r, \theta, \phi \): The spherical coordinates in 3D space.  
- The equation describes a spatially homogeneous and isotropic universe, where the geometry stretches over time due to the expansion factor \( a(t) \).

#### **1.4 Relativity Equation:**  
The relativity equation representing the same concept in a generalized form is given by the following:
\[
ds^2 = g_{ij} dx^i dx^j
\]
- \( ds^2 \): The spacetime interval, as before.  
- \( g_{ij} \): The metric tensor, which encodes the curvature of spacetime.  
- This equation is a more abstract formulation of the same idea, where \( g_{ij} \) is the metric tensor of the universe in a more generalized coordinate system.

### **2. Derivation**  
1. **Einstein's Field Equations:**  
   - Start with Einstein's field equations in General Relativity:
     \[
     R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2} g_{\mu\nu} R = \frac{8 \pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}
     \]
   - In the context of cosmology, the stress-energy tensor \( T_{\mu\nu} \) represents the energy density and pressure of the universe. The left side of the equation describes the curvature of spacetime, and the right side describes the matter and energy content of the universe.  
   - The solution to these equations for a homogeneous and isotropic universe leads to the Robertson-Walker metric.

2. **Robertson-Walker Metric:**  
   - The Robertson-Walker metric is derived under the assumptions of isotropy and homogeneity. The general form of this metric is:
     \[
     ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2 + a(t)^2 \left( \frac{dr^2}{1 - k r^2} + r^2 (d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta d\phi^2) \right)
     \]
   - The term \( a(t) \) represents the scale factor, which varies with time, causing the expansion or contraction of the universe. The curvature term \( k \) determines the geometry of the universe, whether it is open, closed, or flat.

3. **Final Equation:**  
   - The above equation provides the spacetime geometry of a universe that is expanding over time. It captures how distances between points in space change as a function of time due to the cosmological expansion.

### **3. Validation**  
- **Cosmological Observations:**  
  - The cosmological metric is supported by observational evidence, such as the redshift of light from distant galaxies. The further away a galaxy is, the more redshifted its light appears, which indicates that the universe is expanding. This is consistent with the predictions of General Relativity and the Robertson-Walker metric.
  - The cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation also provides evidence for the expanding universe, as the temperature and distribution of the CMB align with the predictions made by General Relativity.

- **Experimental Evidence:**  
  - The Hubble law, which describes the linear relationship between the distance to a galaxy and its recession velocity, is a direct consequence of the expanding universe and is in agreement with the general relativistic model of spacetime expansion.
  - Modern cosmological observations, including data from the Planck satellite and other telescopes, continue to support the predictions made by the General Relativity-based model of cosmological expansion.

- **Limitations:**  
  - The equation assumes a homogeneous and isotropic universe, which is an approximation that works well on large scales but may not hold in more localized regions (e.g., near galaxies or black holes).  
  - The metric does not take into account the effects of dark energy, which has been found to accelerate the expansion of the universe.

### **4. Sample Problem**  
#### **4.1 Problem Statement:**  
A galaxy is located at a comoving distance of 100 megaparsecs (Mpc) from Earth. Given that the Hubble constant is \( H_0 = 70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc} \), calculate the velocity at which the galaxy is receding due to the expansion of the universe.  

#### **4.2 Solution/Calculation:**  
1. **Given:**  
   - Comoving distance of galaxy, \( d = 100 \, \text{Mpc} \)  
   - Hubble constant, \( H_0 = 70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc} \)  

2. **Apply Hubble's Law:**  
   Hubble's Law states that the recession velocity \( v \) of a galaxy is proportional to its distance from the observer:
   \[
   v = H_0 \times d
   \]

3. **Calculate the Recession Velocity:**
   \[
   v = 70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc} \times 100 \, \text{Mpc} = 7000 \, \text{km/s}
   \]

4. **Final Result:**  
   - The galaxy is receding from Earth at a velocity of 7000 km/s due to the expansion of the universe.
