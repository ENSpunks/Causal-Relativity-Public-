### **1. Causal Geometry**  
#### **1.1 Phenomenon:**  
- Cosmological redshift traditionally indicates that light from distant galaxies is stretched due to the expansion of the universe over time. Here, we propose that this redshift can be understood as a result of spatial expansion, where the wavelength of light is stretched because space itself expands, not due to time dilation.

- This equation solves the problem of how light's wavelength changes due to spatial geometry rather than time evolution, offering a spatial reinterpretation of redshift.

#### **1.2 Theory:**  
- Causal Relativity provides a framework where causality is managed through spatial interactions alone. It posits that the expansion of the universe can be seen as a purely spatial phenomenon without the need for temporal expansion.

- Historically, redshift has been linked to the Doppler effect or cosmic expansion over time. This theory reimagines this by focusing solely on spatial geometry.

#### **1.3 Original Equation:**  
- The traditional redshift equation in General Relativity is:
  \[
  1 + z = \frac{a(t_0)}{a(t_e)}
  \]
  where \(a(t)\) is the scale factor of the universe at time \(t\), \(t_0\) is the time of observation, and \(t_e\) is the time of emission.

#### **1.4 Relativity Equation:**  
- In the context of Causal Relativity, we reformulate this as:
  \[
  1 + z = \frac{a(r_0)}{a(r_e)}
  \]
  where \(a(r)\) is now interpreted as the spatial expansion factor at different radial distances \(r\), \(r_0\) is the position of observation, and \(r_e\) is where the light was emitted.

### **2. Derivation**  

- **Starting from the FLRW metric** in General Relativity:
  \[
  ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2 + a(t)^2 \left( \frac{dr^2}{1 - k r^2} + r^2 (d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta d\phi^2) \right)
  \]

- **Remove Temporal Dependency:** We propose that the metric can be conceptualized in a spatial-only context:
  \[
  ds^2 = a(r)^2 \left( \frac{dr^2}{1 - k r^2} + r^2 (d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta \, d\phi^2)\right)
  \]
  Here, \(a(r)\) represents how space expands at different radial distances from the observer.

- **Redshift Derivation:** 
  - Light travels from \(r_e\) to \(r_0\) through this spatially expanding geometry. 
  - The wavelength of light stretches as it travels through regions with different spatial scale factors:
    \[
    \lambda_{\text{observed}} = \lambda_{\text{emitted}} \frac{a(r_0)}{a(r_e)}
    \]
  - By definition, redshift \(z\) is:
    \[
    1 + z = \frac{\lambda_{\text{observed}}}{\lambda_{\text{emitted}}} = \frac{a(r_0)}{a(r_e)}
    \]

### **3. Validation**  

- **Observational Evidence:** The redshift observed from galaxies aligns with this model by considering the spatial stretching of light paths between source and observer.

- **Limitations:** 
  - This model might face challenges explaining phenomena inherently linked to time, like cosmic structure formation or the cosmic microwave background's temporal aspects.
  - It assumes a static snapshot of the universe's expansion, which might not capture dynamic changes.

### **4. Sample Problem**  
#### **4.1 Problem Statement:**  
- Consider light emitted from a galaxy at a distance where \(a(r_e) = 0.5\) and observed at a position where \(a(r_0) = 1.0\). Calculate the redshift \(z\).

#### **4.2 Solution/Calculation:**  
- Using the spatial redshift equation:
  \[
  1 + z = \frac{a(r_0)}{a(r_e)}
  \]
- Substituting the given values:
  \[
  1 + z = \frac{1.0}{0.5} = 2
  \]
- Therefore:
  \[
  z = 2 - 1 = 1
  \]
- The redshift observed is \(z = 1\), which means the wavelength of the light has doubled due to spatial expansion.

### **5. AI Prompt**  
"Given the spatial interpretation of redshift in Causal Relativity where \(a(r_e) = 0.5\) and \(a(r_0) = 1.0\), derive and solve for the redshift \(z\). Validate this approach against traditional redshift calculations using Hubble's Law and discuss the implications of a time-independent model."
