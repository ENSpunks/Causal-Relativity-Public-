### **1. Introduction**  
Gravitational lensing is a phenomenon in which the path of light is bent due to the curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of a massive object. This effect is predicted by Einsteinâ€™s General Theory of Relativity, which describes gravity not as a force but as the result of the curvature of spacetime around massive objects. When light passes near such an object, the curvature causes the light to bend, much like how a lens bends light in optics. This effect is observable in astronomy and has been used to study distant galaxies, stars, and black holes.

### **2. Causal Geometry**  
#### **2.1 Phenomenon:**
- **Gravitational Lensing:** The bending of light due to gravity is referred to as gravitational lensing. When light from a distant star or galaxy passes near a massive object like a galaxy or black hole, the light is bent, and the distant object may appear distorted, magnified, or even duplicated.
- This effect occurs because of the way mass curves the fabric of spacetime, altering the path of light traveling through it. The amount of bending depends on the mass of the object causing the curvature and the distance between the light source, the lensing object, and the observer.

#### **2.2 Theory:**
- **General Relativity:** According to General Relativity, massive objects warp the spacetime around them, and this warping affects the motion of light. Light travels along the curved geodesics (the straight lines in curved spacetime), and as it passes near a massive object, its path bends due to the curvature of spacetime.
- **Gravitational Lensing Equation:** The angle by which light is bent by a gravitational lens can be described by the equation:
  \[
  \theta = \frac{4GM}{c^2 R}
  \]
  where:
  - \( \theta \) is the angle of deflection of the light.
  - \( G \) is the gravitational constant.
  - \( M \) is the mass of the lensing object.
  - \( c \) is the speed of light.
  - \( R \) is the distance between the light source and the lensing object.

#### **2.3 Original Equation:**  
The formula for the angle of deflection of light in gravitational lensing is given by:
\[
\theta = \frac{4GM}{c^2 R}
\]
This equation represents the amount by which light is deflected when it passes near a massive object.

### **3. Derivation**  
1. **Spacetime Curvature:**  
   Gravitational lensing is a direct consequence of the curvature of spacetime predicted by General Relativity. The key component of this curvature is described by the Einstein Field Equations, which relate the curvature of spacetime to the distribution of mass and energy:
   \[
   G_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}
   \]
   where \( G_{\mu\nu} \) is the Einstein tensor, \( T_{\mu\nu} \) is the stress-energy tensor, and \( G \) is the gravitational constant.

2. **Geodesic Equation:**  
   The motion of light in curved spacetime is described by the geodesic equation, which determines the path of a particle (or light) in curved spacetime:
   \[
   \frac{d^2 x^\mu}{d\tau^2} + \Gamma^\mu_{\alpha\beta} \frac{dx^\alpha}{d\tau} \frac{dx^\beta}{d\tau} = 0
   \]
   where \( \Gamma^\mu_{\alpha\beta} \) are the Christoffel symbols that represent the connection coefficients in curved spacetime.

3. **Deflection of Light:**  
   The deflection of light by a gravitational lens can be computed by solving the geodesic equation for light passing near a massive object. In a weak gravitational field (as in the case of most lensing events), the deflection angle \( \theta \) is small and can be approximated using the formula:
   \[
   \theta = \frac{4GM}{c^2 R}
   \]
   where \( R \) is the closest distance of approach between the light and the lensing object. This formula comes from the approximation of the light's path in the weak-field limit and assumes the object is much more massive than the light source.

### **4. Observational Evidence**  
1. **Einstein Rings:**  
   When a massive object (the lens) is precisely aligned between a distant light source and an observer, the light from the source can be bent into a ring-like shape, known as an **Einstein ring**. This is one of the most striking examples of gravitational lensing and provides a direct measurement of the deflection angle \( \theta \).

2. **Multiple Images:**  
   In some cases, gravitational lensing can create multiple images of the same distant object, such as a galaxy or a quasar. The light from the object is bent along different paths, and depending on the geometry, these images can appear as two or more distinct sources.

3. **Galaxy Clusters as Lenses:**  
   Galaxy clusters often act as powerful gravitational lenses. The mass of the cluster bends the light from galaxies and other objects behind it, distorting their images. These lensing effects can be used to map the distribution of dark matter in galaxy clusters.

4. **Gravitational Lensing in Cosmology:**  
   Gravitational lensing has become an important tool in cosmology. By studying lensing events, astronomers can probe the distribution of dark matter, determine the Hubble constant, and even observe distant galaxies that would otherwise be too faint to detect.

### **5. Sample Problem**  
#### **5.1 Problem Statement:**  
Given a galaxy with a mass of \( M = 10^{12} \, \text{M}_\odot \) (where \( \text{M}_\odot \) is the mass of the Sun) acting as a gravitational lens, calculate the deflection angle \( \theta \) for light passing at a distance \( R = 10^6 \, \text{pc} \) (where 1 parsec \( \approx 3.09 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m} \)) from the galaxy.

#### **5.2 Solution:**  
1. **Given:**  
   - Mass of the galaxy, \( M = 10^{12} \, \text{M}_\odot = 10^{12} \times 1.989 \times 10^{30} \, \text{kg} \)  
   - Distance, \( R = 10^6 \, \text{pc} = 10^6 \times 3.09 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m} \)  
   - Gravitational constant, \( G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \text{kg}^{-1} \text{s}^{-2} \)  
   - Speed of light, \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)

2. **Substitute into the Deflection Angle Formula:**
   \[
   \theta = \frac{4GM}{c^2 R}
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   \theta = \frac{4 \times 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \times 10^{12} \times 1.989 \times 10^{30}}{(3 \times 10^8)^2 \times 10^6 \times 3.09 \times 10^{16}}
   \]

3. **Calculation Result:**  
   The result will give the deflection angle in radians, which can be converted to arcseconds for astronomical observation.
