### **1. Causal Geometry**  
#### **1.1 Phenomenon:**  
- The Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation models the probability distribution of finding a particle in stationary states within a spatial volume. Here, it explains how quantum states are distributed in space without the need for time, focusing on the spatial energy levels within Alice's causal sphere.

#### **1.2 Theory:**  
- Quantum mechanics traditionally deals with both time and space; in causal relativity, we focus solely on spatial configurations. This equation is crucial for understanding the spatial distribution of energy within a system, akin to how orbitals are described in atoms but without temporal evolution.

#### **1.3 Original Equation:**  
- \( \hat{H} \psi(x) = E \psi(x) \)
- Erwin Schrödinger developed this equation in 1926 to describe quantum mechanical systems.

#### **1.4 Causal Relativity Equation:**  
- \( \hat{H}_{\text{causal}} \psi(\mathbf{r}) = E_{\text{causal}} \psi(\mathbf{r}) \)
- Here, \( \hat{H}_{\text{causal}} \) represents the spatial Hamiltonian, where the interaction of mass, light, and gravity within the causal sphere influences the energy levels.

### **2. Derivation**  

- **Step 1:** Begin with the concept of a Hamiltonian in quantum mechanics, which in this case must be adjusted to reflect spatial interactions rather than time evolution. 

- **Step 2:** Define the causal Hamiltonian \( \hat{H}_{\text{causal}} \) as composed of spatial operators:
  \[
  \hat{H}_{\text{causal}} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 + V(\mathbf{r})
  \]
  where \( V(\mathbf{r}) \) is the potential energy function in space, adjusted for causal geometry.

- **Step 3:** Solve for stationary states where the wave function \( \psi(\mathbf{r}) \) represents the spatial probability distribution. 

- **Step 4:** The eigenvalue \( E_{\text{causal}} \) now represents energy levels defined by spatial configurations within the causal sphere, not temporal states. This requires solving an eigenvalue problem in three dimensions.

- **Step 5:** Use boundary conditions or symmetry considerations to find allowable solutions for \( \psi(\mathbf{r}) \), which might be altered by the causal geometry.

### **3. Validation**  

- **Validation**: 
  - Experimental observations of atomic and molecular spectra can be reinterpreted in terms of spatial energy distribution rather than time evolution.
  - Simulations of quantum systems could be designed to test the spatial distribution predictions without time.
  
- **Limitations**: 
  - This model must explain phenomena traditionally requiring time, like transitions between states, through spatial mechanics or interactions.

### **4. Sample Problem**  
#### **4.1 Problem Statement:**  
- Consider a particle in a 3D box within Alice's causal sphere. The box has dimensions \( L_x, L_y, L_z \). Calculate the ground state energy and wave function.

#### **4.2 Solution/Calculation:**  
- **Hamiltonian**: 
  \[
  \hat{H}_{\text{causal}} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \left( \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2} \right)
  \]
  with \( V(\mathbf{r}) = 0 \) inside the box.

- **Wave function**: 
  \[
  \psi(\mathbf{r}) = \sqrt{\frac{8}{L_x L_y L_z}} \sin\left(\frac{n_x \pi x}{L_x}\right) \sin\left(\frac{n_y \pi y}{L_y}\right) \sin\left(\frac{n_z \pi z}{L_z}\right)
  \]
  where \( n_x, n_y, n_z \) are quantum numbers, for the ground state all are 1.

- **Energy Calculation**:
  \[
  E_{\text{causal}} = \frac{\hbar^2 \pi^2}{2m} \left( \frac{1}{L_x^2} + \frac{1}{L_y^2} + \frac{1}{L_z^2} \right)
  \]

### **5. AI Prompt**  
- Draft an "AI Prompt" to validate the Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation in Causal Relativity:  
  "Given a particle confined within a 3D box in Alice's causal sphere, determine the ground state energy and wave function using the causal relativity framework. Compare the results with traditional quantum mechanics to validate the spatial interpretation of energy levels."
