## **Causal Geometry**  

### **Phenomenon**  
Electromagnetic induction, traditionally explained by Maxwell's equations, is reinterpreted in Causal Relativity as a phenomenon governed by spatial interactions. The causal framework suggests that electric and magnetic fields interact through the geometry of space rather than changes over time. 

This paper reformulates Ampère's law, focusing on how spacetime curvature influences these fields spatially:

### **Theory**  
Maxwell's equations link electricity, magnetism, and light through time-dependent relations. Causal Relativity extends this by proposing that these interactions can be described without explicit time dependency, emphasizing spatial curvature effects.

### **Original Equation**  
The classical Ampère's law with Maxwell's addition:
\[
\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J} + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}
\]  
- **\(\mathbf{B}\)**: Magnetic field vector  
- **\(\mathbf{J}\)**: Current density vector  
- **\(\mu_0\)**: Permeability of free space  
- **\(\epsilon_0\)**: Permittivity of free space  
- **\(\frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}\)**: Time derivative of the electric field

### **Causal Relativity Equation**  
In this framework, Ampère's law is redefined to:
\[
\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J} + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \kappa \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E}
\]  
- **\(\kappa\)**: A curvature-dependent parameter that quantifies how spacetime curvature affects electromagnetic field interactions. It encapsulates the spatial causality between fields, allowing for the interaction to be described without reference to time.

## **1. Causal Geometry**  

### **1.1 Phenomenon**  
- This equation illustrates how electromagnetic fields interact in curved spacetime, focusing on spatial causality.
- It's crucial for understanding field behavior in regions with significant gravitational influence, like near massive celestial bodies.

### **1.2 Theory**  
- Causal Relativity merges General Relativity's spacetime curvature with electromagnetic theory, suggesting field interactions are spatial phenomena.

### **1.3 Original Equation**  
\[
\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J} + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}
\]  
- This classical form links magnetic fields to electric currents and time-varying electric fields.

### **1.4 Causal Relativity Equation**  
- The time derivative is replaced by a spatial term:
\[
\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J} + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \kappa \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E}
\]  
- Here, the interaction is described by how spatial geometry (via \(\kappa\)) affects the divergence of the electric field, not temporal changes.

## **2. Derivation**  

1. Start with the classical Ampère's law:
   \[
   \nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J} + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}
   \]

2. Remove time dependency by replacing the temporal term with a spatial causality term:
   \[
   \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} \rightarrow \kappa \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E}
   \]

3. Resulting in the fully spatial, time-independent form:
   \[
   \nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J} + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \kappa \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E}
   \]

## **3. Validation**  

- **Experimental Evidence**: 
  - Observations around massive objects where spacetime curvature is significant could support this spatial causality model, examining how fields and light behave.

- **Simulations**: 
  - Numerical models simulating electromagnetic phenomena in curved spacetime can test this theory, emphasizing spatial configurations over time evolution.

## **4. Sample Problem**  

### **4.1 Problem Statement**  
Determine the curl of the magnetic field in a spacetime where a current density \( \mathbf{J} \) exists, with an electric field divergence \( \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = 10^3 \, \text{C/m}^3 \) and a curvature effect parameter \(\kappa = 0.1\), without considering temporal changes.

### **4.2 Solution**  
1. Use the Causal Relativity equation:
   \[
   \nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J} + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \kappa \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E}
   \]

2. With constants (\(\mu_0 = 4\pi \times 10^{-7} \, \text{H/m}, \, \epsilon_0 = 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{F/m}\)):
   \[
   \nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J} + (4\pi \times 10^{-7})(8.85 \times 10^{-12})(0.1)(10^3)
   \]

3. Simplify:
   \[
   \nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J} + 1.11 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{T/m}
   \]

## **5. AI Prompt**  

*Prompt:* "Using the time-independent Causal Relativity equation for Ampère's law (\( \nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J} + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \kappa \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} \)), calculate \( \nabla \times \mathbf{B} \) for given \( \mathbf{J}, \kappa, \) and \( \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} \), focusing on spatial causality. Compare the result to traditional predictions assuming a flat spacetime."

This draft now includes a definition for \(\kappa\), emphasizing its role in describing the spatial effects of spacetime curvature on electromagnetic interactions.
