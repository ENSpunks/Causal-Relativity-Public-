## **Causal Geometry**  

### **Phenomenon**  
Electromagnetic induction, traditionally explained by Maxwell's equations, describes how electric and magnetic fields interact. In Causal Relativity, this interaction is reimagined in a time-independent framework where spacetime curvature influences the fields through spatial geometry rather than temporal changes. 

This paper reformulates Ampère's law to include a term \( \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \kappa \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} \), which accounts for how gravitational fields affect electromagnetic wave behavior in a spatially causal manner.

### **Theory**  
Maxwell's equations form the backbone of classical electromagnetism, linking electricity, magnetism, and light. Causal Relativity extends this by interpreting electromagnetic interactions in curved spacetime without explicit time dependency, focusing on how spatial curvature influences field dynamics.

### **Original Equation**  
The classical Ampère's law with Maxwell's displacement current:
\[
\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J} + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}
\]  
- **\(\mathbf{B}\)**: Magnetic field vector  
- **\(\mathbf{J}\)**: Current density vector  
- **\(\mu_0\)**: Permeability of free space  
- **\(\epsilon_0\)**: Permittivity of free space  
- **\(\frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}\)**: Time derivative of the electric field, indicating its rate of change over time

### **Relativity Equation**  
In Causal Relativity, Ampère's law is modified to:
\[
\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J} + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \kappa \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E}
\]  
- **\(\kappa\)**: A curvature-dependent parameter that reflects the influence of spacetime geometry on electromagnetic fields. This term allows for spatial causality in the interaction between fields, independent of time.

## **1. Causal Geometry**  

### **1.1 Phenomenon**  
- This equation predicts how electromagnetic fields behave in curved spacetime, emphasizing spatial effects over temporal ones.
- It's relevant for understanding phenomena near massive objects where spacetime curvature significantly affects electromagnetic wave propagation.

### **1.2 Theory**  
- General Relativity describes gravity as spacetime curvature, and Causal Relativity integrates this with electromagnetism by proposing that electromagnetic interactions can be understood through spatial relationships alone.

### **1.3 Original Equation**  
\[
\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J} + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}
\]  
- This equation links magnetic fields to both electric currents and changing electric fields in flat spacetime.

### **1.4 Causal Relativity Equation**  
- By replacing the time derivative with a term involving \(\kappa\), this equation becomes:
\[
\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J} + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \kappa \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E}
\]  
- Here, electromagnetic interactions are viewed through the lens of spatial curvature, where \(\kappa\) quantifies how this curvature influences the electric field's divergence.

## **2. Derivation**  

1. Begin with the classical Ampère's law:
   \[
   \nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J} + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}
   \]  

2. In Causal Relativity, eliminate the time-dependent term by introducing a spatial curvature effect:
   \[
   \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} \rightarrow \kappa \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E}
   \]  

3. This yields the time-independent, spatially causal form:
   \[
   \nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J} + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \kappa \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E}
   \]

## **3. Validation**  

- **Experimental Results:** 
  - Observations of electromagnetic phenomena near black holes or neutron stars could validate this spatial interpretation, particularly in how light bends or how fields interact in extreme gravity.

- **Simulations:** 
  - Numerical simulations of electromagnetic fields in curved spacetime can confirm the predictions of this modified equation, focusing on spatial effects rather than temporal dynamics.

## **4. Sample Problem**  

### **4.1 Problem Statement**  
Given a scenario where a current density \( \mathbf{J} \) generates a magnetic field in a curved spacetime with a divergence of the electric field \( \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = 10^3 \, \text{C/m}^3 \) and \( \kappa = 0.1 \), find \( \nabla \times \mathbf{B} \) without considering changes over time.

### **4.2 Solution**  
1. Apply the Causal Relativity form of Ampère's law:
   \[
   \nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J} + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \kappa \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E}
   \]  

2. Use the values (\( \mu_0 = 4\pi \times 10^{-7} \, \text{H/m}, \, \epsilon_0 = 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{F/m} \)):
   \[
   \nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J} + (4\pi \times 10^{-7})(8.85 \times 10^{-12})(0.1)(10^3)
   \]  

3. Simplify:
   \[
   \nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J} + 1.11 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{T/m}
   \]
