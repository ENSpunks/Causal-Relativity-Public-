Newton's Gravitational Force

Transformation Notation:

\[ \mathcal{T}: F(G, m_1, m_2, r) \rightarrow K(G, M, r) \]

Where:
- \( \mathcal{T} \) represents the transformation operator
- Input variables: Gravitational constant (G), masses (m1, m2), distance (r)
- Output variables: Gravitational constant (G), primary mass (M), distance (r)

Key transformation: Reducing mass variables from two to one while preserving the fundamental gravitational relationship.
