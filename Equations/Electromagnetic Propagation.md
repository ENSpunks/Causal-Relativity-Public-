#### **Abstract:**

This paper introduces a derivation of Maxwell's equations within the framework of Causal Relativity, where traditional notions of time are replaced by spatial interactions. By reinterpreting electromagnetic phenomena through the lens of causal spheres, we propose a new set of equations where electromagnetic wave propagation is understood purely in spatial terms, without invoking time as a variable. This approach not only aligns with the concept of causality in space but also provides a novel perspective on how light travels, interacts, and carries information from one causal sphere to another.

#### **Introduction:**

Maxwell's equations describe the fundamental laws of electromagnetism, traditionally involving both spatial and temporal derivatives. In Causal Relativity, where time is not a dimension, we need to reframe these laws to account for causality solely through spatial interactions. The core idea is that electromagnetic waves propagate due to the spatial causality between electric and magnetic fields, where each field's change spatially induces the other.

#### **Theoretical Background:**

- **Causal Spheres:** In Causal Relativity, mass (m), light (l), and gravity (g) form the basis of causality, leading to the concept of causal spheres for each entity in space. 

- **Electromagnetic Field Propagation:** Traditionally, electromagnetic waves are seen as oscillations of electric and magnetic fields over time. Here, we will reinterpret this propagation as a spatial interaction where causality is the driving force.

#### **Deriving Causal Relativity Equations:**

1. **Faraday's Law in Causal Relativity:**

   Traditional form:
   \[
   \nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}
   \]

   In Causal Relativity, we replace the temporal derivative with a spatial causality term. Let's define causality in terms of spatial derivatives:

   \[
   \nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\kappa \nabla \cdot \mathbf{B}
   \]

   Here, \(\kappa\) represents a spatial causality coefficient, which could be derived from the interaction strength between causal spheres.

2. **Ampere's Law with Maxwell's Addition:**

   Traditional form:
   \[
   \nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J} + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}
   \]

   In Causal Relativity, we eliminate the time derivative and introduce a spatial causality link:

   \[
   \nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J} + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \kappa \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E}
   \]

   Here, \(\mathbf{J}\) represents the current density, which remains a spatial vector, but the causality between E and B fields is now spatial.

3. **Wave Equation in Vacuum:**

   Normally derived from Maxwell's equations, the wave equation in a vacuum would be:

   \[
   \nabla^2 \mathbf{E} - \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{E}}{\partial t^2} = 0
   \]

   In Causal Relativity, we propose:

   \[
   \nabla^2 \mathbf{E} - \kappa^2 \nabla^2 \mathbf{E} = 0
   \]

   Since \(\kappa\) would need to encapsulate the speed of light in terms of spatial causality:

   \[
   \kappa = \frac{1}{c}
   \]

   Making the equation:

   \[
   (1 - \kappa^2) \nabla^2 \mathbf{E} = 0
   \]

   This equation describes waves propagating in space due to spatial interactions rather than temporal changes.

#### **Interpretation in the Alice and Bob Thought Experiment:**

- **Photon Propagation:** A-Photon's journey from Alice to Bob is described by these spatial causality equations. The photon's path and interaction are governed by spatial changes in E and B fields rather than temporal evolution.

- **Causality:** The interaction between Alice and Bob's causal spheres can be seen as the spatial overlap of their electromagnetic fields, where causality is the spatial propagation of these fields.

#### **Implications:**

- **New Understanding of Light:** Light propagation is now understood as a series of spatially induced field changes, explaining phenomena like reflection, refraction, and absorption without invoking time.

- **Electromagnetic Interactions:** The spatial causality approach redefines how electromagnetic interactions occur, potentially simplifying complex systems in terms of spatial geometry.

#### **Challenges and Future Directions:**

- **Empirical Verification:** Experimental setups must be designed to observe these spatial causality effects in electromagnetic phenomena.
- **Integration with Quantum Mechanics:** Further work is needed to reconcile this spatial-only approach with quantum mechanics, particularly regarding the role of quanta in causality.

#### **Conclusion:**

This paper has outlined a method to derive the behavior of electromagnetic waves in a space-only context of Causal Relativity. By focusing on spatial causality, we provide a new framework for understanding light propagation, interaction, and the fundamental nature of electromagnetic phenomena within a universe where time does not exist as a separate dimension.
