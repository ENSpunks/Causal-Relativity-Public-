## \[ \boxed{ \mathcal{E} = \int_{\Omega} \left( M + L + G \right) \, d\mathcal{V} } \]

Where:

- **\( \mathcal{E} \)** represents the total 'causal energy' or 'everything' in the causal framework, encapsulating all interactions within and between causal spheres.
- **\( M \)**, **\( L \)**, and **\( G \)** symbolize mass, light, and gravity respectively, each contributing to the spatial configuration and interaction within the theory:
  - **M (Mass)** - Represents the intrinsic property of matter causing spatial curvature.
  - **L (Light)** - Stands for electromagnetic phenomena, including the propagation of light through space without temporal dependency.
  - **G (Gravity)** - Describes gravitational interactions as spatial curvature effects without the traditional time component.
- **\( \Omega \)** is the domain of integration, representing all of space where these interactions occur, effectively covering all causal spheres.
- **\( d\mathcal{V} \)** denotes the differential volume element in this 4D spatial framework, integrating over all possible configurations or interactions in space.
