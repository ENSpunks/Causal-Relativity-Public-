## Abstract:  
This paper reinterprets the Big Bang through Causal Relativity, where the traditional temporal framework is replaced by spatial interactions. We propose that the universe's origin is an initial state of extreme spatial curvature without a temporal singularity, using a new equation for spatial curvature to describe this cosmic inception and evolution.

## Introduction:  
The conventional Big Bang theory describes the universe expanding from a singularity. In Causal Relativity, we suggest the universe began from a state of maximal spatial curvature, which then expanded spatially. This paper redefines the Big Bang's beginning and evolution, employing an equation that reflects this spatial perspective.

---

## Theoretical Background:  
In traditional cosmology:

- **Singularity:** The universe starts at an infinitely dense point in time.

- **Inflation:** A rapid expansion to explain uniformity.

Causal Relativity proposes:

- **Causal Geometry:** Where the Big Bang is the initial spatial configuration of extreme curvature, evolving without a temporal singularity.

---

### **Causal Geometry Consistent with the Big Bang**

Here, we explore the Big Bang through Causal Spheres:

- **Initial State of the Universe:**

  - **Maximal Spatial Curvature:** The universe starts with all mass-energy distributed over an initial spatial configuration.

- **Evolution from Initial State:**

  - **Spatial Expansion:** Seen as the unfolding of space from high to lower curvature, akin to inflation but as a spatial phenomenon.

  - **New Causal Relativity Equation:**  
    \[
    I_{\text{universe, initial, causal}} = \frac{A_{\text{initial}}}{4l_P^2} \left(1 + f(K)\right)
    \]
    Where \( A_{\text{initial}} \) is the initial spatial configuration's area, \( l_P \) the Planck length, and \( f(K) \) a function of curvature \( K \):

    - **Function \( f(K) \):** Reflects how curvature influences the distribution of initial information or energy, possibly \( f(K) = \frac{A_{\text{inner}} + A_{\text{outer}}}{4A_{\text{total}}} (1 + K) \) where \( A_{\text{inner}} \) and \( A_{\text{outer}} \) are areas within and beyond the initial state, and \( A_{\text{total}} \) is the total area.

    - **At the "Beginning":** This equation suggests a finite distribution of information rather than an infinite density.

    - **During Expansion:** As the universe expands, \( A_{\text{initial}} \) becomes less significant compared to the growing universe's area, reducing \( K \)'s influence.

- **Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB):** 

  - The CMB is interpreted as light from this initial spatial state, distributed and redshifted due to spatial expansion.

## Reinterpretation in Causal Relativity:

- **Mathematical Derivation:**

  - This equation provides a spatial-only description of the Big Bang's initial conditions.

- **Conceptual Explanation:**

  - **Avoiding Temporal Singularity:** The universe's origin is a spatial state, not a point in time.

  - **Resolving the Singularity:** Mass-energy starts distributed across space, not concentrated at a point.

- **Potential Interpretation:**

  - **Initial Spatial State:** The Big Bang is the spatial unfolding from a highly curved state.

  - **Inflation as Spatial Expansion:** Inflation is the rapid spatial relaxation to a less curved universe.

---

## Comparison with Observations:  
- This spatial model should explain the CMB's uniformity, universe's expansion, and structure formation without time.

- It must account for CMB anisotropies through spatial variations in initial curvature or mass-energy distribution.

---

## Implications:  
- Offers a time-less explanation for cosmic inflation and initial conditions.
- Could reshape our understanding of dark energy, matter, and CMB in spatial terms.

---

## Challenges and Critiques:  
- Explaining dynamic cosmic processes without time.
- Matching spatial-only predictions with time-based cosmological observations.

---

## Conclusion:  
This paper presents the Big Bang as an initial spatial curvature state within Causal Relativity, potentially resolving traditional singularities and offering new views on cosmic evolution. Further theoretical and observational work is required to validate this spatial interpretation of cosmology.
