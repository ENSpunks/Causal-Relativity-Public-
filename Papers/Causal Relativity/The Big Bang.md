## Abstract:  
This paper revisits the Big Bang theory through the lens of Causal Relativity, where traditional temporal concepts are replaced by spatial interactions. By employing a novel spatial metric, we propose that the universe's origin can be understood without invoking a temporal singularity, instead suggesting an initial spatial state of extreme curvature where all mass-energy is distributed. We utilize a new equation for spatial curvature to describe the Big Bang, providing insights into the initial conditions and evolution of the cosmos.

## Introduction:  
The Big Bang theory posits that the universe began from an infinitely hot and dense point, expanding over time. In Causal Relativity, we propose to view this event not as a moment in time but as a configuration in space where all matter and energy were initially compressed into a highly curved spatial geometry, which then expanded. This paper explores how this model redefines the beginning of the universe, using a new equation to describe the initial state and evolution of the cosmos.

## Theoretical Background:  
In traditional cosmology, the Big Bang is modeled with:

- **Singularity:** An initial point of infinite density and temperature from which the universe expands.

- **Inflation:** A rapid expansion phase that smooths out initial inhomogeneities.

Causal Relativity introduces:

- **Causal Geometry:** A spatial framework where the Big Bang represents the initial condition of extreme spatial curvature, which then evolves, suggesting no need for a temporal singularity.

---

### **Causal Geometry Consistent with the Big Bang**

Here, we examine the Big Bang through the interactions of Causal Spheres:

- **Initial State of the Universe:**

  - **Spatial Confinement:** Instead of a temporal beginning, we consider the universe starting in a state of maximal spatial curvature where all mass-energy is distributed across an initial spatial volume.

  - **Mass-Energy Distribution:** The mass-energy of the universe, which would traditionally be at a singularity, is here distributed over what could be considered an "initial spatial shell" or boundary.

- **Evolution from Initial State:**

  - **Expansion as Spatial Unfolding:** The expansion of the universe is seen as the spatial geometry relaxing from this highly curved state to a more uniform, less curved state, akin to inflation but without needing an initial temporal singularity.

  - **Using the Causal Relativity Equation:**  
    \[
    ds^2 = \left(1 - \frac{r_s}{r} + \kappa \left(\frac{A_{\text{initial}}}{A_{\text{current}}}\right)\right) dr^2 + r^2 (d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta \, d\phi^2)
    \]
    Here, \( r_s \) represents a scale related to the initial curvature, \( \kappa = 1 \) for simplicity, \( A_{\text{initial}} \) represents the area of this initial spatial configuration, and \( A_{\text{current}} \) is the expanding area of the universe.

    - **At the "Beginning":** When \( r \to r_s \), the spatial metric suggests finite curvature, avoiding the concept of infinite density:
      \[
      ds^2 = dr^2 + r_s^2 (d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta \, d\phi^2)
      \]

    - **As the Universe Expands:** The term \(\left(\frac{A_{\text{initial}}}{A_{\text{current}}}\right)\) decreases, reflecting the expansion of space, reducing the curvature.

- **Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB):** 

  - The CMB, a remnant of the Big Bang, can be seen as a spatial distribution of light from this initial state, which, due to the spatial expansion, becomes redshifted and uniform across our observable universe.

---

## Reinterpretation in Causal Relativity:

- **Mathematical Derivation:**

  - The spatial metric above provides a new way to conceptualize the Big Bang as a spatial event, where the universe starts from a highly curved state and evolves to a flatter geometry.

- **Conceptual Explanation:**

  - **No Temporal Singularity:** The universe begins in a spatial configuration of maximum curvature, not at a point in time.

  - **Resolving the Singularity Issue:** By distributing mass-energy across space initially, we avoid the problem of infinite density at a singular point.

- **Potential Interpretation:**

  - **Initial Spatial State:** The Big Bang is the unfolding of space from a highly curved initial state, where all mass-energy was "encoded" or distributed.

  - **Inflation as Spatial Expansion:** What we term inflation can be interpreted as the rapid expansion of this spatial geometry to a less curved state, smoothing out the universe.

---

## Comparison with Observations:  
- This model should account for the uniformity of the CMB, the observed expansion of the universe, and the large-scale structure formation, all as spatial phenomena.

- The distribution of matter and energy at the "beginning" would need to explain the observed anisotropies in the CMB in spatial terms.

---

## Implications:  
- Offers a new approach to understanding cosmic inflation and the initial conditions of the universe without invoking time.
- Might simplify or alter our understanding of dark energy, dark matter, and cosmic microwave background radiation in terms of spatial interactions.

---

## Challenges and Critiques:  
- Reconciling this model with the observed dynamics of the universe, especially how time evolves in physical processes if there's no temporal dimension at the start.
- Validating this spatial Big Bang with cosmological observations currently interpreted through time-dependent models.

---

## Conclusion:  
This paper introduces a spatial-only interpretation of the Big Bang within Causal Relativity, where the universe's origin is described by a state of maximal spatial curvature rather than a temporal singularity. By proposing that all mass-energy was initially distributed on a spatial shell, we offer a new perspective on cosmic evolution, potentially resolving some paradoxes of the traditional Big Bang model. Further theoretical work and observational evidence are needed to explore this spatial description of cosmology.
