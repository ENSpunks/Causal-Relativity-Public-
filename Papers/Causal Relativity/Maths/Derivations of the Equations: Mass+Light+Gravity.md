### Derivations of the Equations: Mass+Light+Gravity

#### **1. Unification of Special Relativity (SR) and General Relativity (GR)**

**Original Equation:**
\[ ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2 + dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2 \]
- This is the Minkowski metric for flat spacetime in SR, where:
  - \(ds^2\) is the spacetime interval.
  - \(c\) is the speed of light.
  - \(dt, dx, dy, dz\) are differentials of time and spatial coordinates.

**Causal Relativity Equation:**
\[ ds^2 = g_{ij} dx^i dx^j \]
- Here, \(g_{ij}\) is the metric tensor in GR, which defines the geometry of spacetime in the presence of mass and energy. This equation describes how spacetime intervals are measured in curved spacetime, where:
  - \(i, j\) are indices running over all spacetime dimensions.
  - \(g_{ij}\) varies with position, reflecting the local gravitational field.

**Derivation:**
- The general form \(g_{ij} dx^i dx^j\) comes from generalizing the flat spacetime metric to include curvature due to mass-energy. In SR, \(g_{ij}\) is constant, but in GR, it's a function of the coordinates reflecting the gravitational field.

#### **2. Singularities (Black Holes/Big Bang)**

**Original Equation:**
\[ R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2}g_{\mu\nu}R = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4}T_{\mu\nu} \]
- This is Einstein's field equation where:
  - \(R_{\mu\nu}\) is the Ricci curvature tensor.
  - \(R\) is the Ricci scalar.
  - \(g_{\mu\nu}\) is the metric tensor.
  - \(T_{\mu\nu}\) is the stress-energy tensor.
  - \(G\) is Newton's gravitational constant.

**Causal Relativity Equation for Schwarzschild Metric:**
\[ ds^2 = \left( 1 - \frac{r_s}{r} \right) c^2 dt^2 - \frac{dr^2}{1 - \frac{r_s}{r}} - r^2 d\theta^2 - r^2 \sin^2\theta d\phi^2 \]
- Here:
  - \(r_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2}\) is the Schwarzschild radius where \(M\) is the mass of the body.
  - The metric describes the geometry outside a spherical mass in vacuum, leading to singularities like black holes.

**Derivation:**
- Starting from Einstein's field equations, one can solve for a vacuum solution around a massive body, leading to the Schwarzschild metric. The singularity at \(r = r_s\) indicates where the curvature becomes infinite, a hallmark of black holes.

### Solving a Problem

Let's solve for the escape velocity from the event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole:

**Problem:** Calculate the escape velocity at the event horizon of a black hole with a mass \(M\).

**Solution:**
- At the event horizon, \(r = r_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2}\).
- The escape velocity \(v_e\) from a point where gravitational potential energy equals kinetic energy is given by:
  \[ \frac{1}{2}mv_e^2 = \frac{GMm}{r} \]
- Here, \(r = r_s\), so:
  \[ \frac{1}{2}v_e^2 = \frac{GM}{r_s} = \frac{GM}{\frac{2GM}{c^2}} = \frac{c^2}{2} \]
- Therefore:
  \[ v_e = c \]

The escape velocity at the event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole is the speed of light, \(c\), which is why nothing, not even light, can escape from within this radius.

### **Verification**

### **1. Unification of SR and GR**

You correctly start with the Minkowski metric for SR:
\[
ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2 + dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2
\]
This is the metric for flat spacetime. You then generalize it to curved spacetime in GR using the metric tensor \(g_{ij}\):
\[
ds^2 = g_{ij} dx^i dx^j
\]
This equation incorporates the curvature of spacetime through \(g_{ij}\), which depends on the mass-energy distribution and varies across spacetime. This generalization aligns with GR principles.

**Key points:**
- Flat spacetime (\(g_{ij}\) constant in SR) becomes a special case of curved spacetime (\(g_{ij}\) varies in GR).
- The use of the metric tensor is consistent with GR formulations.

### **2. Singularities and Schwarzschild Metric**

Starting from Einstein's field equations:
\[
R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2}g_{\mu\nu}R = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4}T_{\mu\nu}
\]
You derive the Schwarzschild metric as a vacuum solution (\(T_{\mu\nu} = 0\)) for a spherically symmetric mass:
\[
ds^2 = \left( 1 - \frac{r_s}{r} \right) c^2 dt^2 - \frac{dr^2}{1 - \frac{r_s}{r}} - r^2 d\theta^2 - r^2 \sin^2\theta d\phi^2
\]
Where \(r_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2}\) is the Schwarzschild radius.

**Key points:**
- The Schwarzschild metric is derived as a solution to Einstein's equations in a vacuum around a spherical mass.
- The singularity at \(r = r_s\) represents the event horizon of a black hole.

### **3. Escape Velocity at Event Horizon**

You solve for the escape velocity \(v_e\) using energy conservation:
\[
\frac{1}{2}mv_e^2 = \frac{GMm}{r}
\]
At \(r = r_s\), substitute \(r_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2}\):
\[
\frac{1}{2}v_e^2 = \frac{GM}{\frac{2GM}{c^2}} = \frac{c^2}{2}
\]
Solve for \(v_e\):
\[
v_e = c
\]
This confirms that the escape velocity at the event horizon equals the speed of light, \(c\), which is why nothing can escape.
