**Describe Phenomena:**

Consider the phenomenon of **gravitational time dilation** traditionally explained by General Relativity, where time runs slower in stronger gravitational fields. In our Causal Relativity framework, we reinterpret this as **spatial dilation** where the spatial distance between points in a gravitational field appears dilated to an observer outside the field.

**Problem:**

A student proposes to calculate the spatial dilation effect experienced by an observer at a distance \(r\) from a black hole of mass \(M\) compared to an observer infinitely far away. This is analogous to calculating gravitational time dilation but in a purely spatial context.

**Conditions:**

- **Mass of the Black Hole (M)**: \(M = 10M_{\odot}\) (where \(M_{\odot}\) is the solar mass).
- **Distance from Black Hole (r)**: \(r = 100 \, \text{km}\).
- **Speed of Light (c)**: \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\).
- **Gravitational Constant (G)**: \(G = 6.67430 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \text{kg}^{-1} \text{s}^{-2}\).

**Derive Causal Relativity Equations:**

In traditional GR, the time dilation factor near a mass is given by:
\[ \Delta t' = \Delta t \sqrt{1 - \frac{2GM}{c^2 r}} \]

In Causal Relativity, we interpret this as spatial dilation, where \(\Delta L'\) is the dilated spatial distance observed from far away, and \(\Delta L\) is the actual spatial distance at \(r\):

\[ \Delta L' = \Delta L \sqrt{1 - \frac{2GM}{c^2 r}} \]

Here, \(\Delta L\) could be considered as a spatial interval or distance in the local frame of the observer near the black hole.

**Solve/Calculate:**

Let's calculate the spatial dilation factor for an observer at \(r = 100 \, \text{km}\) from a black hole with \(M = 10M_{\odot}\):

First, calculate the Schwarzschild radius \(r_s\):

\[ r_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2} = \frac{2 \times 6.67430 \times 10^{-11} \times 10 \times 1.989 \times 10^{30}}{(3 \times 10^8)^2} \approx 29.53 \, \text{km} \]

Now, use this in our spatial dilation equation:

\[ \Delta L' = \Delta L \sqrt{1 - \frac{2 \times 6.67430 \times 10^{-11} \times 10 \times 1.989 \times 10^{30}}{(3 \times 10^8)^2 \times 100 \times 10^3}} \]

\[ \Delta L' = \Delta L \sqrt{1 - \frac{2 \times 6.67430 \times 10^{20}}{9 \times 10^{20}}} \]

\[ \Delta L' = \Delta L \sqrt{1 - 0.1486} \]

\[ \Delta L' = \Delta L \sqrt{0.8514} \]

\[ \Delta L' \approx \Delta L \times 0.9227 \]

So, the spatial dilation factor is approximately 0.9227, meaning the spatial distance appears about 92.27% of its actual value when observed from far away.

**Validate Solution/Calculation:**

In traditional physics, the time dilation factor for the same scenario would be calculated as:

\[ \Delta t' = \Delta t \sqrt{1 - \frac{2GM}{c^2 r}} = \Delta t \sqrt{1 - 0.1486} = \Delta t \times 0.9227 \]

This result aligns with the time dilation factor calculated in General Relativity, confirming that the spatial dilation approach in Causal Relativity provides a consistent reinterpretation of the effect. This alternative method of viewing gravitational effects in terms of spatial dimensions without time would be particularly intriguing because it challenges the conventional understanding while still producing results consistent with known physics. As a professor, I would be fascinated by this approach for its conceptual novelty and its ability to maintain physical accuracy.
