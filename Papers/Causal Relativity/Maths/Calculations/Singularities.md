### **Causal Sphere Thought Experiment with Alice for Resolving Singularities**

**Problem:**
To explore a solution for avoiding the quantization of space, curvature, and gravity while resolving the singularity problem in black holes within the Causal Relativity framework.

**Conditions:**
- **Alice (Star/Black Hole)**: Initially a star, Alice undergoes a transformation into a black hole, represented as a causal sphere.
- **Causal Shell Configuration**: After transformation, Alice's mass core, with quantum properties, becomes a mass shell due to extreme spatial curvature.
- **Holographic Principle**: The mass is encoded on the area of this curvature, utilizing the holographic principle to avoid singularities.

**Causal Sphere Thought Experiment:**

Imagine Alice as a star that undergoes a supernova, entering a phase where her causal structure changes dramatically. As Alice becomes a black hole, her mass does not collapse into an infinitely dense point but instead forms a shell due to the intense curvature of space around her. This curvature is so profound that light emitted from within cannot escape, creating what we traditionally call the event horizon.

To address the singularity problem without invoking quantization, we apply the holographic principle in a novel manner:

- **Mass Shell Formation**: Alice's mass, influenced by quantum properties, transitions into a shell-like structure due to the curvature. This shell is not infinitely thin but has a finite thickness, representing the spatial extent of the black hole's mass.

- **Holographic Encoding**: According to the holographic principle, all the information of the 3D volume can be encoded on a 2D surface. Here, we propose that Alice's mass is encoded on both the inner and outer boundaries of this curvature:

  - **Inner Boundary**: The mass is encoded on the inner surface of the shell, representing the interior of the black hole where light cannot escape.

  - **Outer Boundary**: Similarly, the mass is encoded on the outer surface, which could be interpreted as the event horizon from an external perspective.

- **Doubling the Volume**: By encoding the mass on both sides of the curvature, we effectively double the 'volume' of the area where the mass information is stored. This approach suggests that the density of the mass is distributed over a larger effective area, avoiding the infinite density at a singularity by spreading the mass across this dual-surface configuration.

**Derive Causal Relativity Equations:**

Given this thought experiment, we can modify our approach to the metric without introducing explicit quantization:

\[ ds^2 = \left(1 - \frac{r_s}{r} + \kappa \left(\frac{A_{\text{inner}} + A_{\text{outer}}}{A_{\text{total}}}\right)\right) dr^2 + r^2 (d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta \, d\phi^2) \]

Here:
- \( r_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2} \) remains the Schwarzschild radius.
- \( \kappa \) is a constant that scales the contribution of the holographic encoding, ensuring the curvature remains finite. This constant could be derived from considerations of how mass distribution affects curvature in this model.
- \( A_{\text{inner}} \) and \( A_{\text{outer}} \) are the areas of the inner and outer boundaries of the mass shell, respectively.
- \( A_{\text{total}} \) is the total effective area where the mass is encoded.

This metric modification ensures that even at \( r = r_s \), the term involving spatial curvature does not go to zero or infinity, as the additional term from the holographic principle provides a finite correction.

**Solve/Calculate:**

At the event horizon, \( r = r_s \):

\[ ds^2 = \left(1 - \frac{r_s}{r_s} + \kappa \left(\frac{A_{\text{inner}} + A_{\text{outer}}}{A_{\text{total}}}\right)\right) dr^2 + r_s^2 (d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta \, d\phi^2) \]

\[ ds^2 = \kappa \left(\frac{A_{\text{inner}} + A_{\text{outer}}}{A_{\text{total}}}\right) dr^2 + r_s^2 (d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta \, d\phi^2) \]

Since \( A_{\text{inner}} \) and \( A_{\text{outer}} \) are finite, and by choosing \( \kappa \) appropriately, we ensure that \( ds^2 \) remains finite, indicating a finite density distribution.

**Validate Solution/Calculation:**

- **Consistency with Observations**: This model aligns with the observed behavior of black holes where light cannot escape past the event horizon, but without the need for a singularity. The dual-surface encoding of mass provides a mechanism to distribute mass density, avoiding infinite density while maintaining the black hole's characteristics.

- **Theoretical Predictions**: By suggesting that the mass forms a shell with information encoded on both sides, we resolve the singularity issue by distributing mass over an area rather than a point, consistent with the spirit of the holographic principle but without quantization.

- **Implications for Singularity**: This approach suggests that the singularity can be understood as a finite density distribution spread across the inner and outer surfaces of the event horizon, potentially offering a more intuitive resolution to the problem of singularities in black holes.

In conclusion, this thought experiment and calculation provide a method to resolve the issue of singularities in black holes within Causal Relativity by utilizing the holographic principle to encode mass on both the inner and outer boundaries, effectively doubling the 'volume' of the area and ensuring finite density. This approach avoids the need for quantization, offering a spatial interpretation that aligns with known physical principles while providing a novel perspective on black hole structure.
