### **Causal Sphere Thought Experiments with Alice and Bob for visualization, problem solving, validation, and continued development.**

#### **Prompt:**

**Problem:**
State the specific problem or effect you want to explore, like the formation of an Einstein ring or the spatial dilation effect due to relative motion.

**Conditions:**
List the conditions or parameters for Alice and Bob (e.g., mass, distance, velocity, light wavelength) that are relevant to the problem.

**Casual Sphere Thought Experiment:**
Explain how Alice and Bob, as causal spheres (comprising mass, light, and gravity), interact to manifest the phenomenon under study, e.g., gravitational lensing, spatial dilation.

**Derive Causal Relativity Equations:**
Derive the equations in the context of Causal Relativity, focusing on how mass, light, and gravity interact spatially without invoking time.

**Solve/Calculate:**
Perform the necessary calculations using the derived equations, showing the steps to arrive at a numerical result.

**Validate Solution/Calculation:**
Compare the calculated outcome with known observations or theoretical predictions from traditional relativity to validate the approach.
