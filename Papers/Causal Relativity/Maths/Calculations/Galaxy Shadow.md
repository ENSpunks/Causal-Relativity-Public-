## **Abstract**  
This paper reexamines the galaxy shadow problem through the framework of Causal Relativity, a spatial-only reinterpretation of traditional spacetime. In traditional general relativity, the shadow of a galaxy emerges from the gravitational lensing of light caused by its mass-energy curvature. Here, we reinterpret this phenomenon using causal spheres, exploring the interaction between mass-energy curvature and propagating light shells. First, we approach the problem without the holographic principle, identifying limitations of a purely spatial causal framework. We then incorporate the holographic principle to encode information on the galaxy's causal boundary, demonstrating its utility in resolving these limitations and providing a novel understanding of causal interactions in space without time.

## **1. Introduction**  
### **1.1 Context in Traditional Relativity**  
The galaxy shadow problem refers to the phenomenon where a galaxy's mass-energy distribution curves spacetime, altering light trajectories to produce observable effects like gravitational lensing and shadows. These effects are well-modeled in general relativity, where time and space interplay dynamically.

### **1.2 Motivation for Causal Relativity**  
This paper explores the galaxy shadow problem within the framework of Causal Relativity, which eliminates the temporal dimension in favor of spatial-only causal interactions. By interpreting galaxies as causal spheres, the interaction between mass-energy curvature (future space) and light propagation (past space) becomes a purely spatial phenomenon, raising questions about how shadows and lensing emerge without a time variable.

2. Explore the galaxy shadow problem without the holographic principle.  
3. Incorporate the holographic principle to resolve limitations.

## **2. Theoretical Background**  
### **2.1 Basics of Causal Relativity**  
Causal Relativity replaces spacetime with spatial-only constructs. Key postulates include:  
- Causal Spheres: Regions of space influenced by mass-energy curvature, defining causal boundaries.  
- Causal Density: The curvature effect of mass-energy as a function of distance.  
- Light Propagation: Interpreted as spatial waves interacting with causal boundaries.

### **2.2 Traditional General Relativity**  
In general relativity, the shadow emerges from geodesic equations governing light in curved spacetime. The Schwarzschild radius and Einstein field equations describe how mass-energy curves spacetime and bends light trajectories.

## **3. Causal Sphere Thought Experiments**  
### **3.1 Alice and Bob as Interacting Causal Spheres**  
Consider two causal spheres, Alice and Bob:  
- **Alice (Galaxy):** Mass-energy \( M_{\text{galaxy}} \) defines a causal boundary curving space around her.  
- **Bob (Light Shell):** A propagating light wave originating near Alice, whose trajectory is influenced by Alice’s curvature.  

In a spatial-only framework, Alice’s curvature mediates the interaction by altering Bob’s causal path, encoding gravitational effects purely in space.

## **4. Solving the Galaxy Shadow Problem**  
### **4.1 Without the Holographic Principle**  
#### **Mathematical Derivation**  
The causal boundary radius for Alice is defined as:  
\[
r_s = \frac{2GM_{\text{galaxy}}}{c^2},
\]  
where \( r_s \) determines the curvature strength. Light propagates from Bob with a trajectory \( r_{\text{light}} \):  
\[
r_{\text{light}} = c \cdot t.
\]  
Without time, replace \( t \) with spatial displacement:
\[
r_{\text{light}} = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}.
\]

Gravitational effects distort Bob’s trajectory as:
\[
\vec{F}(r) = - \nabla \left( \frac{GM_{\text{galaxy}}}{r} \right).
\]

#### **Results and Interpretation**  
Without the holographic principle, the causal density function \( C(r) \) only partially captures the interaction, leading to undefined behavior near boundaries or singularities. The absence of encoded information on the boundary complicates the emergence of a coherent shadow.

---

### **4.2 Incorporating the Holographic Principle**  
#### **Mathematical Derivation**  
Introduce the holographic principle, encoding mass-energy curvature on the boundary of Alice’s causal sphere:  
\[
A = 4 \pi r_{\text{boundary}}^2, \quad S \propto A.
\]

The causal density function is modified as:
\[
C(r) = \frac{\rho_{\text{galaxy}}}{r^2} + \frac{S}{r_{\text{boundary}}^2}.
\]

Light propagation now interacts with the encoded boundary:
\[
\vec{F}_{\text{encoded}}(r) = - \nabla \left( \frac{GM_{\text{galaxy}}}{r} + \frac{S}{r_{\text{boundary}}^2} \right).
\]

#### **Results and Interpretation**  
With holographic encoding, the boundary becomes a mediator, resolving singularities and ensuring that information about the galaxy’s mass-energy is accessible throughout the system. The shadow emerges as a natural consequence of light trajectories interacting with this encoded curvature.

## **5. Implications**  
1. **Physics:** Incorporating the holographic principle into Causal Relativity provides a robust spatial framework for understanding galaxy-scale phenomena.  
2. **Philosophy:** The reinterpretation suggests that boundaries, not volumes, are fundamental to causal interactions.  

---

## **6. Challenges and Critiques**  
1. **Non-Linearities:** Strong curvature regions require more sophisticated causal density functions.  
2. **Experimental Validation:** Designing experiments to test spatial-only causal effects remains challenging.

---

## **7. Conclusion**  
This paper demonstrates how the galaxy shadow problem can be reframed in Causal Relativity. While the spatial-only approach faces limitations without the holographic principle, encoding information on causal boundaries resolves key challenges and provides new insights into causal dynamics in space without time.
