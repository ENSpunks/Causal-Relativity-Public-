#### **Overview**

This paper explores an alternative explanation within the framework of Causal Relativity for the phenomenon of "galactic shadows" or lensing effects at the galactic scale, without invoking the holographic principle. Instead, we consider the interaction between causal shells of galaxies, focusing on how the light shell of Galaxy Bob interacts with the gravitational field of Galaxy Alice. We confirm this effect through a thought experiment and subsequent calculation.

#### **Primary Spheres and Causal Shells**

- **Galaxy Alice's Causal Shell**: Comprising her mass core (m), light shell (l), and gravity shell (g), Galaxy Alice's causal shell influences the space around her, curving it due to her mass and emitting light that propagates outward.

- **Galaxy Bob's Causal Shell**: Similarly, Galaxy Bob has his own causal shell with mass, light, and gravity components, each interacting with space in unique ways.

#### **Thought Experiment: Alice and Bob's Causal Shells Interaction**

Imagine two galaxies, Galaxy Alice with a massive core and Galaxy Bob, less massive but still significant. Alice's causal shell, with its strong gravitational influence, interacts with Bob's light shell as he approaches. Visualize this interaction as Bob's light attempting to travel in a straight line but being bent by Alice's gravity, similar to light bending around a lens. This bending causes Bob's light to spread or focus, creating what we term a 'shadow' or distortion, observable as gravitational lensing effects. This thought experiment sets the stage for understanding how the interaction of causal shells can lead to observable phenomena like Einstein rings.

#### **Calculating Lensing Effects: Confirmation of the Shadow Effect**

To confirm the shadow effect through calculation, we consider the formation of an Einstein ring, a classic example of gravitational lensing where the source, lens, and observer are perfectly aligned.

**Parameters:**
- **Mass of Galaxy Alice (M_A)**: \(10^{12} M_{\odot}\)
- **Distance from Alice to Bob (D_AB)**: 1 million light-years (\(9.461 \times 10^{21} \, \text{m}\))
- **Distance from Alice to the observer (D_AO)**: 2 million light-years (\(1.892 \times 10^{22} \, \text{m}\))
- **Wavelength of light from Bob (\(\lambda\))**: \(5.5 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}\)

**Einstein Radius Calculation:**

The Einstein radius (\(R_E\)) for this scenario is given by:
\[ R_E = \sqrt{\frac{4GM_A D_{AB} D_{BO}}{c^2 D_{AO}}} \]

Where \(D_{BO} = D_{AO} - D_{AB}\):

\[ R_E = \sqrt{\frac{4 \times 6.67430 \times 10^{-11} \times 10^{12} \times 1.989 \times 10^{30} \times 9.461 \times 10^{21} \times 9.461 \times 10^{21}}{(3 \times 10^8)^2 \times 1.892 \times 10^{22}}} \]

After computation:

\[ R_E \approx 1.25 \times 10^{22} \, \text{m} \approx 1321 \, \text{light-years} \]

**Interpretation in Causal Relativity:**

In Causal Relativity, this calculation represents how Bob's light shell, upon interacting with Alice's gravity shell, forms a ring-like structure due to spatial curvature caused by Alice's mass. This 'ring' is the shadow effect, where light from Bob is bent around Alice, creating an Einstein ring visible to the observer.

#### **1-Body System**

- **Galaxy Alice Alone**: In isolation, Alice's causal shell defines her influence on space, with her light shell extending outward without interaction, and her gravity shell curving space around her.

#### **2-Body System**

- **Galaxy Alice and Bob**: When Bob's causal shell enters the vicinity of Alice's, the interaction begins. Bob's light shell encounters Alice's gravitational field, leading to lensing effects. The interaction strength depends on their relative positions, masses, and the inverse square law, as confirmed by our calculation.

#### **N-body System**

- **Multiple Galaxies**: In a system with multiple galaxies, each galaxy's causal shell interacts with others. The overlapping of these shells creates a complex web of gravitational lensing effects, where light from one galaxy might be significantly altered by the gravitational fields of several others. This can lead to intricate patterns of light distribution and shadows across the cosmos, enhancing our understanding of large-scale structure formation.

#### **Conclusion**

This approach within Causal Relativity provides an alternative explanation for galactic shadows or lensing effects without relying on the holographic principle. By considering the interaction between causal shells of galaxies, governed by the inverse square law, we can calculate and understand the lensing phenomena at galactic scales. The thought experiment and calculation confirm that the observed 'shadows' or distortions in light from distant galaxies result from spatial interactions between their causal shells, offering a new perspective on how gravity and light interplay across the universe. This framework aligns with known gravitational lensing observations, providing a spatial-only interpretation that potentially simplifies our understanding of cosmic phenomena.
