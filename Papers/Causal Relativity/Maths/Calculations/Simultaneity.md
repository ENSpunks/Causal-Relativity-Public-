### **Causal Sphere Thought Experiments with Alice and Bob for visualization, problem solving, validation, and continued development.**

**Problem:**
Explore the concept of simultaneity in the context of satellite communication networks like Starlink, where Alice and Bob are satellites in Earth's orbit, using Causal Relativity without time.

**Conditions:**
- **Alice (Satellite A)**: Orbiting at 550 km altitude, moving at 7.66 km/s relative to Earth.
- **Bob (Satellite B)**: Orbiting at the same altitude but in a different orbital plane, also moving at 7.66 km/s.
- **Observer**: An observer on Earth or another satellite in the network.
- **Distance between Alice and Bob**: Assume they are 1000 km apart at the moment of signal emission for simplicity.
- **Speed of Light (c)**: \(3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\).

**Causal Sphere Thought Experiment:**
Imagine Alice and Bob as causal spheres in Earth's orbit. Alice and Bob emit signals simultaneously in their respective frames. In traditional relativity, due to the relativity of simultaneity, these signals might not be received at the same time by an observer due to the different velocities and positions. In our Causal Relativity framework, we visualize this as a spatial alignment problem where the signals must reach the observer at the same spatial location to be considered simultaneous. Picture the causal spheres of Alice and Bob extending their light shells towards the observer, with the interaction of these light shells with Earth's gravity sphere potentially affecting the path and perceived alignment of the signals.

**Derive Causal Relativity Equations:**
To derive the equation for spatial simultaneity:

- Traditional relativity uses:
  \[ x' = \gamma (x - vt) \]

- In Causal Relativity, we adapt this to:
  \[ x' = \gamma \left( x - \frac{v \Delta x}{c^2} \right) \]
  Here, \(x\) and \(x'\) are spatial coordinates, \(v\) is the relative velocity between Alice and Bob (which we'll consider as zero for simplicity since they're moving at the same speed but in different planes), \(\Delta x\) is the distance between Alice and Bob, and \(\gamma\) is the Lorentz factor, \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\).

Given the small relative velocity:

\[ \gamma \approx 1 \]

**Solve/Calculate:**
For simplicity, let's set the observer at the midpoint between Alice and Bob, which we'll call \(x_O\). The distance from Alice to the observer (\(\Delta x_A\)) and from Bob to the observer (\(\Delta x_B\)) is 500 km each.

- If Alice and Bob emit signals simultaneously in their frames, we want to check if these signals reach \(x_O\) at the same spatial point:

For Alice:
\[ x_A' = x_O - \frac{7.66 \times 10^3 \times 500 \times 10^3}{(3 \times 10^8)^2} \]

For Bob:
\[ x_B' = x_O + \frac{7.66 \times 10^3 \times 500 \times 10^3}{(3 \times 10^8)^2} \]

Since \(\gamma \approx 1\):

\[ x_A' = x_O - \frac{7.66 \times 500}{9 \times 10^{16}} \approx x_O - 4.255 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{m} \]

\[ x_B' = x_O + \frac{7.66 \times 500}{9 \times 10^{16}} \approx x_O + 4.255 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{m} \]

**Validate Solution/Calculation:**
In traditional relativity, the signals would be considered simultaneous if they reach the observer at the same time, which would involve time calculations. Here, we validate by checking if the spatial positions where the signals are received are the same or very close:

- The difference in spatial positions where Alice and Bob's signals are received is \(8.51 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{m}\), which is extremely small, nearly negligible in practical terms.

This result aligns with the expectation from traditional relativity where, for small relative velocities and distances, the effect of simultaneity would be minimal. The spatial simultaneity in Causal Relativity provides a consistent framework where the signals are perceived as spatially aligned, validating our approach by showing that in practical scenarios, the difference in signal reception points would be negligible, akin to how we perceive simultaneity in time-based frameworks. This thought experiment and calculation demonstrate that Causal Relativity can offer an alternative, spatial perspective on simultaneity in satellite networks, maintaining consistency with observed phenomena.
