Time Dilation:

Original: [ \Delta t' = \gamma \Delta t ]

Causal Relativity:

Time dilation is reinterpreted as spatial dilation: [ \Delta L' = \Delta L \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} ]
Problem: If a clock on a moving spaceship ticks once every second in its frame, how much spatial dilation occurs if it moves at 0.6c relative to an observer?

Here, (\Delta L) is the spatial distance the light travels in one tick in the rest frame, and (\Delta L') is in the observer's frame: [ \Delta L' = \Delta L \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{0.6c}{c}\right)^2} = \Delta L \sqrt{1 - 0.36} = \Delta L \times 0.8 = 0.8 \Delta L ]
