Energy of Light in Gravitational Field:

Original: [ E_{\text{out}} = E_{\text{in}} \left( \frac{r_s}{r} \right) ]

Causal Relativity:

Adjusts energy in spatial terms: [ E_{\text{out}} = E_{\text{in}} \left( \frac{r_s}{r} \right) ]
Problem: Calculate the energy of a photon once it has escaped from just above the event horizon of a black hole with (M = 5M_{\odot}) if its energy at the event horizon was 1 J.

(r_s = \frac{2 \times 6.67430 \times 10^{-11} \times 5 \times 1.989 \times 10^{30}}{(3 \times
