Mass-Energy Equivalence:

Original: [ E = mc^2 ]

Causal Relativity:

Remains the same, interpreted as spatial energy density: [ E = mc^2 ]
Problem: What's the energy equivalent of 1 kg of mass?

Using (c = 3 \times 10^8 , \text{m/s}): [ E = 1 \times (3 \times 10^8)^2 = 9 \times 10^{16} , \text{J} ]
