Newton's Gravitational Force:

Original: [ F = \frac{Gm_1 m_2}{r^2} ]

Causal Relativity:

Here, force is reinterpreted as spatial curvature. Since gravity in Causal Relativity is not just a force but a curvature of space, we define: [ K = \frac{GM}{r^2} ] where (K) is the curvature at a distance (r) from a mass (M).
Problem: Calculate the spatial curvature around Earth at a distance where the International Space Station (ISS) orbits (approximately 400 km).

Given: Earth's mass (M_{\text{Earth}} \approx 5.97 \times 10^{24} , \text{kg}), radius (r \approx 6.371 \times 10^6 , \text{m} + 400 \times 10^3 , \text{m} = 6.771 \times 10^6 , \text{m}), (G \approx 6.67430 \times 10^{-11} , \text{m}^3 \text{kg}^{-1} \text{s}^{-2}): [ K = \frac{6.67430 \times 10^{-11} \times 5.97 \times 10^{24}}{(6.771 \times 10^6)^2} \approx 8.89 \times 10^{-10} , \text{m}^{-2} ]
