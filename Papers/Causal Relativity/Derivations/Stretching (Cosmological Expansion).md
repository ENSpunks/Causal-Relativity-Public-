Stretching (Cosmological Expansion):

Original: [ ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2 + a(t)^2 \left( \frac{dr^2}{1 - k r^2} + r^2 (d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta , d\phi^2) \right) ]

Causal Relativity:

We consider only the spatial part for cosmological expansion: [ ds^2 = g_{ij} dx^i dx^j ]
Problem: For a flat universe expanding uniformly where (a(t) = t), how does the spatial metric look?

In a flat universe ((k=0)), and considering spatial components only: [ ds^2 = t^2 \left( dr^2 + r^2 (d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta , d\phi^2) \right) ]
