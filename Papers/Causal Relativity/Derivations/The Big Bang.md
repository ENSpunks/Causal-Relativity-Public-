The Big Bang

Original Concept:
The Big Bang theory describes the universe's origin from an infinitely hot, dense point, expanding over time. The traditional model involves a temporal singularity.

Causal Relativity Interpretation:
In Causal Relativity, we interpret the Big Bang not as a temporal singularity but as an initial state of extreme spatial curvature where all matter and energy are distributed. The expansion of the universe is thus seen as a relaxation of this curvature, leading to a more uniform spatial distribution.

Causal Relativity Equation for the Big Bang:
We modify the spatial metric to reflect this initial extreme spatial curvature and its subsequent expansion:

[ ds^2 = \left(1 - \frac{r_s}{r} + \kappa \left(\frac{A_{\text{initial}}}{A_{\text{current}}}\right)\right) dr^2 + r^2 (d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta , d\phi^2) ]

Explanation of Terms:
( r_s ) - Represents a scale related to the initial curvature of the universe, not necessarily linked to a mass like in black holes but to the initial spatial confinement.
( \kappa = 1 ) - A constant for simplicity, akin to previous models.
( A_{\text{initial}} ) - The area (or volume in 3D) of the universe at the "beginning", where all mass-energy is highly concentrated in space.
( A_{\text{current}} ) - The area (or volume) of the universe as it expands, reflecting the current spatial distribution of mass and energy.
Problem:
Calculate how the spatial curvature changes from the initial state of the universe to its current state, assuming ( M_{\text{initial}} ) represents all the mass-energy initially present.

Solution:

Let's consider the Big Bang as a spatial event where ( r ) represents the expanding radius of the universe:
[ ds^2 = \left(1 - \frac{r_s}{r} + 1 \left(\frac{A_{\text{initial}}}{A_{\text{current}}}\right)\right) dr^2 + r^2 (d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta , d\phi^2) ]

At the "beginning", when ( r \to r_s ):
[ ds^2 = \left(1 - \frac{r_s}{r_s} + \frac{A_{\text{initial}}}{A_{\text{initial}}}\right) dr^2 + r_s^2 (d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta , d\phi^2) ]

[ ds^2 = (1 - 1 + 1) dr^2 + r_s^2 (d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta , d\phi^2) ]

[ ds^2 = dr^2 + r_s^2 (d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta , d\phi^2) ]

This indicates that at the initial moment, the spatial interval remains finite, avoiding the concept of infinite density or a singularity.

As the universe expands:

( \frac{A_{\text{initial}}}{A_{\text{current}}} ) becomes very small, suggesting: [ ds^2 \approx \left(1 - \frac{r_s}{r}\right) dr^2 + r^2 (d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta , d\phi^2) ] For large ( r ), this approximates to a flat universe metric, which aligns with current observations of cosmic flatness.
This model implies that the Big Bang is an event of spatial geometry changing from highly curved to less curved, where the expansion of the universe is a spatial phenomenon, not a temporal one. The initial conditions are set by spatial curvature rather than a moment in time, potentially resolving some issues with the traditional Big Bang singularity.
