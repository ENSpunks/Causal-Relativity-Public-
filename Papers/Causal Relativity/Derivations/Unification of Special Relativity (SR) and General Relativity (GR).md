Unification of Special Relativity (SR) and General Relativity (GR)

Original Equation: [ ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2 + dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2 ]

This is the Minkowski metric for flat spacetime in SR, where:
(ds^2) is the spacetime interval.
(c) is the speed of light.
(dt, dx, dy, dz) are differentials of time and spatial coordinates.
Causal Relativity Equation: [ ds^2 = g_{ij} dx^i dx^j ]

Here, (g_{ij}) is the metric tensor in GR, which defines the geometry of spacetime in the presence of mass and energy. This equation describes how spacetime intervals are measured in curved spacetime, where:
(i, j) are indices running over all spacetime dimensions.
(g_{ij}) varies with position, reflecting the local gravitational field.
Derivation:

The general form (g_{ij} dx^i dx^j) comes from generalizing the flat spacetime metric to include curvature due to mass-energy. In SR, (g_{ij}) is constant, but in GR, it's a function of the coordinates reflecting the gravitational field.
