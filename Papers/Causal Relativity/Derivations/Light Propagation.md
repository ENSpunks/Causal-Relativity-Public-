Light Propagation (Relativity):

Original: [ t = \frac{d}{c} ]

Causal Relativity:

We express this in terms of spatial displacement: [ r = c \cdot \Delta d ]
Problem: How far does light travel in a vacuum in 1 second?

Given (c = 3 \times 10^8 , \text{m/s}), and (\Delta d = 1 , \text{s}): [ r = 3 \times 10^8 , \text{m} ]
Light Speed in Vacuum:

Original: [ ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2 + dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2 ]

Causal Relativity:

Removing the time component, we get: [ ds^2 = dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2 ]
Problem: Calculate the spatial interval for light moving at a 45-degree angle from the x-axis in the xy-plane over a distance of 1 light-second in the x-direction.

Since (dx = c \cdot 1 , \text{s} = 3 \times 10^8 , \text{m}), and (dy = dx) for a 45-degree angle: [ ds^2 = (3 \times 10^8)^2 + (3 \times 10^8)^2 \implies ds = \sqrt{2} \times 3 \times 10^8 \approx 4.24 \times 10^8 , \text{m} ]
Light Travel Time:

Original: [ r = c \cdot \Delta d ]

Causal Relativity:

This equation remains identical, considering spatial intervals: [ r = c \cdot \Delta d ]
Problem: If light travels 1.5 million km from the Sun to Earth, how long does it take in spatial terms?

Distance (r = 1.5 \times 10^9 , \text{m}), speed of light (c = 3 \times 10^8 , \text{m/s}): [ \Delta d = \frac{r}{c} = \frac{1.5 \times 10^9}{3 \times 10^8} = 5 , \text{s} ]
