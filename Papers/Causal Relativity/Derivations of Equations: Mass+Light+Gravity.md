### Derivations of Equations: Mass+Light+Gravity

Here's a quick and dirty derivation and explanation of the key ideas behind the transformations and equations presented in your table, especially focusing on how causal effects modify classical and quantum mechanical equations. We'll look at how basic equations are adapted to incorporate "causal" effects, such as curvature, boundaries, and relativistic factors.

### 1. **Quantum State Evolution**
   **Theory**: Quantum Mechanics  
   **Original Equation**:  
   \[
   i \hbar \frac{\partial \psi(\mathbf{r}, t)}{\partial t} = \hat{H} \psi(\mathbf{r}, t)
   \]
   **Causal Relativity Equation**:  
   \[
   \hat{H}_{\text{causal}} \psi(\mathbf{r}) = E_{\text{causal}} \psi(\mathbf{r})
   \]
   
   **Derivation**:  
   The Schrodinger equation governing quantum evolution is modified in the "causal" framework, where the Hamiltonian \( \hat{H} \) might be affected by spacetime curvature or other relativistic effects. This is captured by introducing a modified Hamiltonian \( \hat{H}_{\text{causal}} \), which leads to a different energy eigenvalue \( E_{\text{causal}} \). This can be related to the curvature of spacetime.

### 2. **Particle in Spherical Well**
   **Theory**: Quantum Mechanics  
   **Original Equation**:  
   \[
   E_n = \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \left(\frac{n\pi}{R}\right)^2
   \]
   **Causal Relativity Equation**:  
   \[
   E_{n,\text{causal}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \left(\frac{n\pi}{R_{\text{causal}}}\right)^2, \quad R_{\text{causal}} = R \left(1 + \frac{\Delta R}{R}\right)
   \]
   
   **Derivation**:  
   In a spherical potential well, the radius \( R \) affects the energy levels. When considering relativistic or causal effects, such as space curvature, the radius \( R_{\text{causal}} \) may differ slightly due to such perturbations. \( \Delta R \) represents the deviation due to these effects, making the energy eigenvalue \( E_{n,\text{causal}} \) differ from the standard case.

### 3. **Time-Dependent Harmonic Oscillator**
   **Theory**: Quantum Mechanics  
   **Original Equation**:  
   \[
   i \hbar \frac{\partial \psi(x,t)}{\partial t} = \left[ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 x^2 + \lambda x \cos(\omega_0 t) \right] \psi(x,t)
   \]
   **Causal Relativity Equation**:  
   \[
   \hat{H}_{\text{causal}} \psi(\mathbf{r}) = E_{\text{causal}} \psi(\mathbf{r}), \quad \hat{H} = \frac{-\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 x^2 + \lambda x \cos(kx)
   \]
   
   **Derivation**:  
   In the causal framework, the harmonic potential may also experience perturbations due to the geometry of space-time, which affects the oscillatory potential. The frequency term \( \lambda x \cos(kx) \) replaces \( \lambda x \cos(\omega_0 t) \) to account for a spatial, rather than temporal, perturbation.

### 4. **Energy Eigenvalue Problem**
   **Theory**: Quantum Mechanics  
   **Original Equation**:  
   \[
   \hat{H} \psi(x) = E \psi(x)
   \]
   **Causal Relativity Equation**:  
   \[
   \hat{H}_{\text{causal}} \psi(\mathbf{r}) = E_{\text{causal}} \psi(\mathbf{r}), \quad \hat{H} = \frac{-\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 x^2 + \lambda x \cos(kx)
   \]
   
   **Derivation**:  
   The energy eigenvalue equation is adjusted by introducing a modified Hamiltonian, incorporating the effects of curvature or causality that modify the effective potential or space in which the particle exists.

### 5. **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**
   **Theory**: Quantum Mechanics  
   **Original Equation**:  
   \[
   \Delta x \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}
   \]
   **Causal Relativity Equation**:  
   \[
   \Delta x \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}
   \]
   
   **Derivation**:  
   The Heisenberg uncertainty principle remains unaltered, even in causal relativity. However, the spatial uncertainty \( \Delta x \) may be influenced by the underlying spacetime curvature, resulting in shifts in the effective distribution of particles in space.

### 6. **Event Horizon Information (Black Hole Entropy)**
   **Theory**: General Relativity  
   **Original Equation**:  
   \[
   S_{\text{BH}} = \frac{A}{4l_P^2}
   \]
   **Causal Relativity Equation**:  
   \[
   S_{\text{BH}, \text{causal}} = \frac{A}{4l_P^2} \left(1 + \frac{\Delta A}{A}\right)
   \]
   
   **Derivation**:  
   The entropy of a black hole is related to the area of its event horizon. In the causal framework, the area \( A \) may experience variations due to spacetime fluctuations, curvature, or boundary effects, leading to a modified entropy formula.

### 7. **Cosmology and Big Bang Initial Information**
   **Theory**: Cosmology  
   **Original Equation**:  
   \[
   I_{\text{universe, initial}} = \frac{A}{4l_P^2}
   \]
   **Causal Relativity Equation**:  
   \[
   I_{\text{universe, initial, causal}} = \frac{A_{\text{initial}}}{4l_P^2} \left(1 + f(K)\right)
   \]
   
   **Derivation**:  
   The information content in the universe's initial state is related to the area of the universe's boundary. Causal effects and spacetime curvature \( K \) modify the initial boundary, altering the calculated information.

### 8. **Information Bound (Holographic Principle)**
   **Theory**: Holographic Principle  
   **Original Equation**:  
   \[
   I \leq \frac{A}{4l_P^2}
   \]
   **Causal Relativity Equation**:  
   \[
   I_{\text{causal}} = \frac{A}{4l_P^2} \left(1 + \frac{\Delta A}{A}\right)
   \]
   
   **Derivation**:  
   The holographic principle suggests that information content is proportional to the area, not volume. Causal effects that influence the area can modify this bound by introducing factors that reflect curvature or spacetime dynamics.
