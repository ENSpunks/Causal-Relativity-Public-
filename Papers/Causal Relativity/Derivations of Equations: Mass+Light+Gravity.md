# Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity Equations in a Timeless Context

## 1. Quantum State Evolution (No Time)
**Theory:** Quantum Mechanics  
**Original Equation (with time):**

$$
i \hbar \frac{\partial \psi(r, t)}{\partial t} = \hat{H} \psi(r, t)
$$

**Causal Relativity Equation (No time):**

$$
\hat{H}_{causal} \psi(r) = E_{causal} \psi(r)
$$

**Interpretation:**  
Without time evolution, the state function \( \psi(r) \) becomes a spatially localized function, and the Hamiltonian \( \hat{H}_{causal} \) still governs the spatial distribution of the wave function. The energy eigenvalue \( E_{causal} \) reflects a spatially-dependent effect, perhaps influenced by the geometry of the space itself, but time is not a factor in this equation anymore.

## 2. Particle in Spherical Well (No Time)
**Theory:** Quantum Mechanics  
**Original Equation (with time):**

$$
E_n = \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \left( \frac{n \pi}{R} \right)^2
$$

**Causal Relativity Equation (No time):**

$$
E_{n, causal} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \left( \frac{n \pi}{R_{causal}} \right)^2, \quad R_{causal} = R \left( 1 + \frac{\Delta R}{R} \right)
$$

**Interpretation:**  
This spatial-only equation models a particle's energy in a static potential well. Without time, we only care about the spatial configuration and the curvature of the well itself. The "causal" adjustment here would modify the radius \( R_{causal} \) based on spatial curvature effects, but time is not involved in the modification.

## 3. Time-Dependent Harmonic Oscillator (No Time)
**Theory:** Quantum Mechanics  
**Original Equation (with time):**

$$
i \hbar \frac{\partial \psi(x, t)}{\partial t} = \left[ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 x^2 + \lambda x \cos(\omega_0 t) \right] \psi(x, t)
$$

**Causal Relativity Equation (No time):**

$$
\hat{H}_{causal} \psi(r) = E_{causal} \psi(r), \quad \hat{H} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 x^2 + \lambda x \cos(kx)
$$

**Interpretation:**  
In this spatial-only version, the time-dependent oscillatory term \( \cos(\omega_0 t) \) is removed and replaced with a spatial term \( \cos(kx) \), making the potential function depend only on spatial coordinates. The Hamiltonian is purely spatial, and causal effects could modify the potential, but there’s no time evolution in this framework.

## 4. Energy Eigenvalue Problem (No Time)
**Theory:** Quantum Mechanics  
**Original Equation (with time):**

$$
\hat{H} \psi(x) = E \psi(x)
$$

**Causal Relativity Equation (No time):**

$$
\hat{H}_{causal} \psi(r) = E_{causal} \psi(r), \quad \hat{H} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 x^2 + \lambda x \cos(kx)
$$

**Interpretation:**  
This remains a spatial-only equation where the Hamiltonian describes the energy distribution of the particle in a given spatial potential. The key difference is that the Hamiltonian could now be modified to account for spatial curvature or other causal effects, but there's no temporal evolution involved.

## 5. Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (No Time)
**Theory:** Quantum Mechanics  
**Original Equation (with time):**

$$
\Delta x \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}
$$

**Causal Relativity Equation (No time):**

$$
\Delta x \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}
$$

**Interpretation:**  
The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle still applies in the absence of time, as it concerns the spatial uncertainty in position and momentum. In a timeless framework, this could be interpreted as a spatial distribution-based uncertainty, where \( \Delta x \) and \( \Delta p \) reflect the spatial properties of the system rather than any dynamic evolution over time.

## 6. Event Horizon Information (Black Hole Entropy)
**Theory:** General Relativity  
**Original Equation (with time):**

$$
S_{BH} = \frac{A}{4 l_P^2}
$$

**Causal Relativity Equation (No time):**

$$
S_{BH, causal} = \frac{A}{4 l_P^2} \left( 1 + \frac{\Delta A}{A} \right)
$$

**Interpretation:**  
The entropy of a black hole, traditionally associated with a horizon that evolves over time, is instead modified by the area of the event horizon in this timeless context. \( \frac{\Delta A}{A} \) reflects any perturbations in the area due to spacetime curvature, and the information content is a spatially-dependent measure.

---

## 7. Cosmology and Big Bang Initial Information (No Time)
**Theory:** Cosmology  
**Original Equation (with time):**

$$
I_{universe, initial} = \frac{A}{4 l_P^2}
$$

**Causal Relativity Equation (No time):**

$$
I_{universe, initial, causal} = \frac{A_{initial}}{4 l_P^2} \left( 1 + f(K) \right)
$$

**Interpretation:**  
The initial state of the universe is described purely by spatial geometry. The information content \( I \) is tied to the area \( A_{initial} \), but now it's modified by curvature effects \( f(K) \), reflecting spatial geometry rather than a time-evolving process.

---

## 8. Information Bound (Holographic Principle)
**Theory:** Holographic Principle  
**Original Equation (with time):**

$$
I \leq \frac{A}{4 l_P^2}
$$

**Causal Relativity Equation (No time):**

$$
I_{causal} = \frac{A}{4 l_P^2} \left( 1 + \frac{\Delta A}{A} \right)
$$

**Interpretation:**  
In the absence of time, the holographic bound is modified by spatial geometry. The curvature effects \( \frac{\Delta A}{A} \) affect the area and, hence, the information content, but there’s no temporal component to the equation.

---

## Conclusion:
In this timeless or spatial-only framework, the core concept is that spatial geometry and causal effects (like curvature or boundary conditions) influence the systems, but time evolution is either absent or considered emergent. The equations from quantum mechanics and general relativity adapt to this context by focusing solely on spatial parameters, and any time dependence (like in the wavefunction evolution or harmonic oscillator) is removed or replaced with purely spatial interactions.
