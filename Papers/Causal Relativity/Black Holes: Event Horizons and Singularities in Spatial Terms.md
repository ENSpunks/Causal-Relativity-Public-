**Abstract:**  
This paper reimagines black holes within the Causal Relativity framework, where traditional temporal dynamics are replaced by spatial interactions. We introduce a novel spatial metric to describe black holes, suggesting that singularities can be resolved by considering mass and energy distribution across the event horizon in a purely spatial context. An updated equation for spatial curvature is presented, aligning with cosmological principles akin to the Big Bang's spatial interpretation.

**Introduction:**  
In General Relativity, black holes are defined by an event horizon beyond which escape is impossible, leading to a central singularity. This paper proposes a reinterpretation within Causal Relativity, where time is not considered, and spatial geometry dictates black hole characteristics. We explore how this model redefines black holes, employing an updated equation to describe spatial curvature at and within the event horizon.

---

**Theoretical Background:**  
General Relativity describes black holes with metrics like Schwarzschild's, focusing on:

- **Event Horizon:** The boundary beyond which no information can escape.
- **Singularity:** A point of infinite density and curvature.

Causal Relativity introduces:

- **Causal Geometry:** Here, we propose a spatial-only framework where the event horizon represents extreme spatial curvature, and the singularity's traditional role is reimagined as distributed mass and energy across space.

### **Causal Geometry Consistent with Black Holes**

We explore black holes through the lens of interacting Causal Spheres:

- **Alice's Journey into the Black Hole:**

  - **Initial Condition:** Alice and Bob, near a black hole, interact via their respective Mass Cores, Light Shells, and Gravity Shells.

  - **Approaching the Event Horizon:** 

    - **Mass Core Interaction:** Alice's trajectory is influenced by the black hole's spatial curvature.

    - **Gravity Shell:** The black hole's gravity bends space, forming the event horizon as a spatial boundary.

    - **Light Shell:** Light from Alice bends back due to curvature, appearing from Bob's perspective as if she never crosses the horizon, as light paths curve back inside.

- **Event Horizon and Singularity:**

  - **Spatial Event Horizon:** This boundary is where space curves so extensively that no path leads outward.

  - **Avoiding Singularity:** We introduce an updated spatial metric, inspired by cosmological spatial interpretations:
    \[
    ds^2 = \left(1 - \frac{r_s}{r} + f(K)\right) dr^2 + r^2 (d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta \, d\phi^2)
    \]
    Here, \( r_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2} \), and \( f(K) \) is a function of curvature \( K \), analogous to the Big Bang's spatial curvature function:

    \[
    f(K) = \frac{A_{\text{inner}} + A_{\text{outer}}}{4A_{\text{total}}} \left(1 + K\right)
    \]
    - Where \( A_{\text{inner}} = A_{\text{outer}} = 4\pi r_s^2 \), and \( A_{\text{total}} = 8\pi r_s^2 \), and \( K \) represents additional curvature effects. At the event horizon, this metric ensures:

    \[
    ds^2 = \left(1 + f(K)\right) dr^2 + r_s^2 (d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta \, d\phi^2)
    \]

    - **Mass Encoding:** Mass is proposed to be encoded on the horizon's surface, potentially resolving the information paradox.

    - **Light Core:** Light within the horizon forms a dense, finite core, rather than collapsing to a point.

- **Unified Spatial Interpretation:**

  - **Causal Geometry of Black Holes:** This model interprets black hole features as spatial phenomena, redefining the interior geometry.

---

**Reinterpretation in Causal Relativity:**

- **Mathematical Derivation:**

  - The updated spatial metric describes the geometry around and within a black hole, ensuring finite spatial intervals even at the event horizon through the function \( f(K) \).

- **Conceptual Explanation:**

  - **Event Horizon as Spatial Boundary:** Seen as a limit where spatial curvature dictates no escape, not a temporal boundary.

  - **Singularity Resolution:** Mass distribution over the horizon avoids infinite density, with light forming a dense but finite core.

- **Potential Interpretation:**

  - **Mass Encoding:** Similar to cosmological principles, mass and information are distributed across the event horizon.

  - **Light Core:** Light forms a dense structure, providing a spatial resolution to what would be a singularity in traditional models.

---

**Comparison with Observations:**  
- This model should align with observed gravitational effects like lensing but reinterpreted spatially. It would need to account for phenomena like Hawking radiation in a spatial context, perhaps through quantum effects interacting with the horizon's spatial structure.

---

**Implications:**  
- Offers a new perspective on quantum gravity, suggesting information isn't lost but spatially distributed.
- Reimagines stellar end states as spatial configurations, not temporal endpoints.

---

**Challenges and Critiques:**  
- Explaining dynamic processes and energy emissions in purely spatial terms.
- Validating this model against established observations and experiments, especially regarding black hole thermodynamics.

---

**Conclusion:**  
This paper presents a spatial-only interpretation of black holes within Causal Relativity, where the event horizon and internal structure are defined by spatial curvature, inspired by cosmological principles. The resolution of singularities by distributing mass and energy spatially provides a novel approach to understanding these cosmic entities. Further theoretical development and observational evidence are necessary to substantiate this model.
