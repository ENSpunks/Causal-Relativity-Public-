**Abstract:**  
This paper reimagines black holes within the Causal Relativity framework, where traditional temporal dynamics are replaced by spatial interactions. We introduce a novel approach to describe black holes, suggesting that singularities can be resolved by considering the spatial distribution of mass and energy across the event horizon. An updated equation for the entropy of a black hole is presented, accounting for curvature and boundary thickness.

**Introduction:**  
In General Relativity, black holes are characterized by an event horizon and a central singularity. This paper proposes a reinterpretation within Causal Relativity, where time is not considered, and spatial geometry dictates black hole features. We explore how this model redefines black holes, employing an equation that quantifies the information or entropy at the event horizon in spatial terms.

---

**Theoretical Background:**  
General Relativity describes black holes with metrics like Schwarzschild's, focusing on:

- **Event Horizon:** The boundary beyond which no information can escape.
- **Singularity:** A point of infinite density and curvature.

Causal Relativity introduces:

- **Causal Geometry:** Here, we propose a spatial-only framework where the event horizon represents extreme spatial curvature, and the singularity's role is reimagined as distributed entropy.

### **Causal Geometry Consistent with Black Holes**

We explore black holes through the lens of interacting Causal Spheres:

- **Alice's Journey into the Black Hole:**

  - **Initial Condition:** Alice and Bob, near a black hole, interact via their respective Mass Cores, Light Shells, and Gravity Shells.

  - **Approaching the Event Horizon:** 

    - **Mass Core Interaction:** Alice's trajectory is influenced by the black hole's spatial curvature.

    - **Gravity Shell:** The black hole's gravity bends space, forming the event horizon as a spatial boundary.

    - **Light Shell:** Light from Alice bends back due to curvature, appearing from Bob's perspective as if she never crosses the horizon.

- **Event Horizon and Singularity:**

  - **Spatial Event Horizon:** This boundary is where space curves so extensively that no path leads outward.

  - **Entropy at the Event Horizon:**

    - **Causal Relativity Equation for Entropy:**
      \[
      S_{BH,\text{causal}} = \frac{A}{4l_P^2} \left(1 + \frac{\Delta A}{A}\right)
      \]
      Here, \( A \) is the area of the event horizon, \( l_P \) is the Planck length, and \( \Delta A \) represents changes in area due to curvature and boundary thickness, reflecting how spatial effects modify the traditional Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.

    - **Avoiding Singularity:** Through this equation, we suggest that information is encoded spatially across the horizon, avoiding the need for a singularity.

- **Unified Spatial Interpretation:**

  - **Causal Geometry of Black Holes:** This model sees black hole features as spatial phenomena, where entropy is a function of spatial configuration rather than temporal dynamics.

---

**Reinterpretation in Causal Relativity:**

- **Mathematical Derivation:**

  - The equation above redefines black hole entropy in terms of spatial effects, offering a potential resolution to the information paradox.

- **Conceptual Explanation:**

  - **Event Horizon as Information Boundary:** The horizon is where information is spatially encoded, not lost to time.

  - **Singularity Resolution:** By distributing entropy across the horizon, we circumvent the concept of infinite density at a point.

- **Potential Interpretation:**

  - **Mass Encoding:** Mass and energy are encoded on the event horizon, suggesting a spatial distribution of information.

  - **Light Core:** Light within the horizon contributes to this spatial entropy, forming a dense but finite structure.

---

**Comparison with Observations:**  
- This model should align with observed gravitational effects like lensing but reinterpreted spatially. It must explain phenomena like Hawking radiation through spatial entropy changes.

---

**Implications:**  
- Proposes a new perspective on quantum gravity, where information is spatially distributed.
- Reinterprets black hole evaporation and information conservation in spatial terms.

---

**Challenges and Critiques:**  
- Explaining dynamic processes like radiation in a spatial-only framework.
- Validating this model against established observations and experiments, particularly regarding black hole thermodynamics.

---

**Conclusion:**  
This paper introduces a spatial-only interpretation of black holes within Causal Relativity, where the event horizon's entropy reflects spatial curvature and area variations. This approach potentially offers a resolution to traditional black hole paradoxes by redefining entropy and information in spatial terms. Further theoretical and observational work is essential to validate this perspective.
