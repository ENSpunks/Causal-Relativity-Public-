Your presentation of the equations and derivation is clear and follows standard physics:

### Original Equation:
\[ F = \frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2} \]

- **F**: Gravitational force (measured in Newtons, N)
- **G**: Gravitational constant (\(6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{Nm}^2/\text{kg}^2\))
- **m_1, m_2**: Masses of the two objects (in kilograms, kg)
- **r**: Distance between the centers of the two masses (in meters, m)

### Relativity Equation:
\[ K = \frac{GM}{r^2} \]

- **K**: Gravitational field strength or acceleration due to gravity (measured in m/sÂ²)
- **M**: Mass of the primary object creating the gravitational field (in kilograms, kg)

### Derivation:

1. **Start with Newton's law of gravitation:**
   \[ F = \frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2} \]

2. **Define K as the gravitational field strength:**
   \[ K = \frac{F}{m_2} \]

   This step indicates that \( K \) is the force per unit mass, which in this case, is the acceleration felt by mass \( m_2 \) due to the gravitational attraction of mass \( m_1 \).

3. **Substitute F into the equation for K:**
   \[ K = \frac{\frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2}}{m_2} \]

4. **Simplify by canceling \( m_2 \) in the numerator and denominator:**
   \[ K = \frac{Gm_1}{r^2} \]

   Here, you've renamed \( m_1 \) to \( M \) to indicate that it's the primary mass creating the gravitational field, independent of the mass of any other object placed within this field.

This derivation shows how the gravitational force between two objects can be transformed into the concept of a gravitational field or acceleration where one mass (M) is considered fixed or primary. In this context:

- **K represents**: Not just acceleration but the intrinsic gravitational field strength due to mass M, which would be experienced by any mass placed at distance r from M. 

- **Time Independence**: In traditional physics, this relationship still involves time implicitly since acceleration is a change in velocity over time. However, in the Causal Relativity context, interpreting this as a static spatial property, where the influence of M on space (or other masses) doesn't inherently require time to describe its effect.
