**Abstract:**  
The Shapiro time delay, where light takes longer to travel through a gravitational field, is traditionally a result of spacetime curvature in General Relativity (GR). This paper proposes an interpretation within Causal Relativity, where causality is explained through spatial interactions without time. We suggest that what is observed as a delay in time can be reconsidered as an increase in spatial path length, offering a new spatial perspective on this phenomenon.

---

**Introduction:**  
The Shapiro time delay effect has been experimentally confirmed, notably in radar signals sent to Mercury or in the timing of pulsar signals. In GR, this effect is due to the bending of light paths in spacetime. Here, we explore how Causal Relativity might reinterpret this delay as a purely spatial effect, where the path of light stretches due to the curvature of space around massive bodies.

---

**Theoretical Background:**  
In GR, the Shapiro delay is quantified by:
- The time taken for light to travel through a gravitational field:
  \[
  \Delta t = \frac{2GM}{c^3} \ln\left(\frac{4r_1 r_2}{b^2}\right)
  \]
  where \(G\) is the gravitational constant, \(M\) is the mass of the gravitating body, \(c\) is the speed of light, \(r_1\) and \(r_2\) are distances from the mass to the points where light enters and leaves the gravitational field, and \(b\) is the impact parameter.

Causal Relativity posits:
- **Causal Geometry**: Instead of time delay, we consider an increase in the spatial distance light must travel due to the curvature around mass.

---

**Reinterpretation in Causal Relativity:**

- **Mathematical Derivation:**
  - Utilizing our spatial metric:
    \[
    ds^2 = \frac{dr^2}{1 - \frac{GM}{r}} + r^2 (d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta \, d\phi^2)
    \]
  - The delay in light travel can be reinterpreted as an increase in the spatial path:
    \[
    \Delta L = \frac{2GM}{c^2} \ln\left(\frac{4r_1 r_2}{b^2}\right)
    \]
    Here, \(\Delta L\) represents the additional spatial distance light must travel, analogous to the time delay.

- **Conceptual Explanation:**
  - Light, traveling through space curved by mass, must follow a longer path than in flat space. This increased path length is what we perceive as a delay, without invoking time.

---

**Comparison with Observations:**  
- Observations of radar echoes from planets or timing anomalies in pulsar signals can be re-evaluated. The 'delay' in these signals would be due to the extra spatial distance traveled, not time dilation.

- Experiments like those with the Cassini spacecraft, which measured the delay in radio signals, would support this model if the spatial path increase is consistent with the observed data.

---

**Implications:**  
- This spatial interpretation could simplify explanations of light travel in gravitational fields, focusing on geometry rather than temporal effects.
- It might also influence how we design experiments to measure or utilize gravitational effects, emphasizing spatial measurements.

---

**Challenges and Critiques:**  
- The challenge lies in explaining dynamic processes or changes in the gravitational field without time, particularly in scenarios where time dilation is a significant factor.
- Critics might argue that this model does not fully capture the temporal aspects of light propagation as understood in GR.

---

**Conclusion:**  
We've proposed that the Shapiro time delay can be understood as a spatial phenomenon within Causal Relativity, where the effect is due to an increase in the spatial path length of light rather than a temporal delay. This reinterpretation maintains consistency with observational data but requires further exploration to address all aspects of light propagation in gravitational fields. The spatial approach might offer new insights into gravitational effects on light.
