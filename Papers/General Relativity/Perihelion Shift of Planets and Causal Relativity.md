**Abstract:**  
The perihelion shift of planets, an anomaly in planetary orbits that led to one of the earliest validations of General Relativity (GR), is here reinterpreted through the lens of Causal Relativity. This theory removes time as a dimension, proposing that the anomalous precession of planetary orbits can be explained by spatial curvature alone. This paper explores how this new spatial model can account for the observed perihelion shifts, suggesting a potentially simpler explanation for this celestial phenomenon.

---

**Introduction:**  
The perihelion shift, particularly of Mercury, was one of the primary pieces of evidence supporting Einstein's General Relativity, where the curvature of spacetime around the Sun causes planets to precess more than predicted by Newtonian mechanics. With Causal Relativity, we propose that this shift can be understood as resulting from the spatial curvature induced by the Sun's mass, without invoking time. 

---

**Theoretical Background:**  
In GR, the precession of the perihelion is given by:
- The Schwarzschild solution predicts an additional precession per orbit:
  \[
  \Delta \phi = \frac{6\pi GM}{c^2 a (1 - e^2)}
  \]
  where \(G\) is the gravitational constant, \(M\) is the mass of the Sun, \(c\) is the speed of light, \(a\) is the semi-major axis of the orbit, and \(e\) is the eccentricity.

Causal Relativity introduces:
- **Causal Geometry**: Here, the orbits of planets are influenced by spatial curvature around the Sun, leading to an additional angular shift in the orbit's perihelion.

---

**Reinterpretation in Causal Relativity:**

- **Mathematical Derivation:**
  - We modify the metric to represent spatial curvature:
    \[
    ds^2 = \frac{dr^2}{1 - \frac{GM}{r}} + r^2 (d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta \, d\phi^2)
    \]
  - The perihelion shift in this model can be derived from the spatial path around the Sun, leading to:
    \[
    \Delta \phi_{Causal} = \frac{6\pi GM}{c^2 a (1 - e^2)} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{r_s}{r}\right)^{-1}
    \]
    where \(r_s\) is a parameter representing the spatial curvature due to mass.

- **Conceptual Explanation:**
  - Planets move in orbits that are not perfectly elliptical due to the spatial curvature around the Sun. Each orbit's path is subtly bent, causing the point of closest approach (perihelion) to advance with each orbit.

---

**Comparison with Observations:**  
- The observed shift of Mercury's perihelion is about 43 arcseconds per century, which our model should replicate when considering the spatial geometry around the Sun.
- This approach should also predict similar shifts for other planets, albeit smaller due to their greater distance from the Sun, matching GR predictions.

---

**Implications:**  
- This interpretation might simplify the teaching and understanding of orbital mechanics by focusing on spatial effects alone.
- It could also lead to new methods for calculating or predicting the orbits of celestial bodies in complex gravitational environments.

---

**Challenges and Critiques:**  
- The model must account for the observed precision of GR's predictions without introducing inconsistencies, particularly for planets with different orbital parameters.
- Critics might argue that removing time could limit the model's ability to handle dynamic systems or interactions between multiple celestial bodies.

---

**Conclusion:**  
We've shown that the perihelion shift of planets can be conceptualized as a consequence of spatial curvature in Causal Relativity, offering an alternative explanation to the traditional GR one. This approach aligns with observational data but invites a reevaluation of how we understand orbits in a time-less universe. Further work should aim at extending this model to other orbital phenomena and complex systems.
