**Abstract:**  
The perihelion shift of planets, an anomaly in planetary orbits that led to one of the earliest validations of General Relativity (GR), is here reinterpreted through the lens of Causal Relativity. This theory removes time as a dimension, proposing that the anomalous precession of planetary orbits can be explained by spatial curvature alone. This paper explores how this new spatial model can account for the observed perihelion shifts, suggesting a potentially simpler explanation for this celestial phenomenon.

---

**Introduction:**  
The perihelion shift, particularly of Mercury, was one of the primary pieces of evidence supporting Einstein's General Relativity, where the curvature of spacetime around the Sun causes planets to precess more than predicted by Newtonian mechanics. With Causal Relativity, we propose that this shift can be understood as resulting from the spatial curvature induced by the Sun's mass, without invoking time. 

---

**Theoretical Background:**  
In GR, the precession of the perihelion is given by:
- The Schwarzschild solution predicts an additional precession per orbit:
  \[
  \Delta \phi = \frac{6\pi GM}{c^2 a (1 - e^2)}
  \]
  where \(G\) is the gravitational constant, \(M\) is the mass of the Sun, \(c\) is the speed of light, \(a\) is the semi-major axis of the orbit, and \(e\) is the eccentricity.

Causal Relativity introduces:
- **Causal Geometry**: Here, the orbits of planets are influenced by spatial curvature around the Sun, leading to an additional angular shift in the orbit's perihelion.

---

### **Causal Geometry Consistent with Perihelion Shift**

In Causal Relativity, the perihelion shift of planets can be conceptualized through the interactions of Causal Spheres. Consider two observers, Alice (on Mercury) and Bob (observing from Earth):

- **Sun's Mass Core:**

  - **Initial Condition:** The Sun's massive Mass Core significantly influences the spatial geometry around it, creating a notable Gravity Shell.

  - **Spatial Curvature:** This curvature:

    - **Gravity Shell:** Bends the space around the Sun, affecting the orbits of planets. This bending is what causes the shift in the perihelion of Mercury's orbit.

- **Alice's Orbit:**

  - **Mercury's Path:** Alice, representing Mercury, orbits the Sun, with her trajectory influenced by this spatial curvature:

    - **Mass Core Interaction:** As Mercury moves through this curved space, its path isn't a perfect ellipse but is slightly twisted due to the spatial geometry around the Sun. 

    - **Path Deviation:** With each orbit, the spatial geometry subtly shifts Mercury's path, leading to an advance in the point of closest approach (perihelion) without invoking time.

- **Bob's Observation:**

  - **Earth's View:** Bob, from Earth, observes this shift over centuries:

    - **Light Shell:** Light from Mercury, representing its position, travels through space affected by the Sun's gravity. The spatial path changes mean that from Bob's perspective, Mercury's orbit appears to precess due to the spatial effects rather than temporal ones.

- **Unified Spatial Interpretation:**

  - **Causal Geometry of Orbit Shift:** In this model, the perihelion shift is explained as a purely spatial phenomenon where the curvature of space around the Sun dictates the path of planets. The precession we observe is the result of how space is configured around massive bodies, offering a new way to understand orbital mechanics without the traditional reliance on time.

**Reinterpretation in Causal Relativity:**

- **Mathematical Derivation:**
  - We modify the metric to represent spatial curvature:
    \[
    ds^2 = \frac{dr^2}{1 - \frac{GM}{r}} + r^2 (d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta \, d\phi^2)
    \]
  - The perihelion shift in this model can be derived from the spatial path around the Sun, leading to:
    \[
    \Delta \phi_{Causal} = \frac{6\pi GM}{c^2 a (1 - e^2)} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{r_s}{r}\right)^{-1}
    \]
    where \(r_s\) is a parameter representing the spatial curvature due to mass.

- **Conceptual Explanation:**
  - Planets move in orbits that are not perfectly elliptical due to the spatial curvature around the Sun. Each orbit's path is subtly bent, causing the point of closest approach (perihelion) to advance with each orbit.

---

**Comparison with Observations:**  
- The observed shift of Mercury's perihelion is about 43 arcseconds per century, which our model should replicate when considering the spatial geometry around the Sun.
- This approach should also predict similar shifts for other planets, albeit smaller due to their greater distance from the Sun, matching GR predictions.

Causal Geometry Calculation of Perihelion

Sun's Mass Core:

Initial Condition: The Sun's massive Mass Core creates a significant spatial curvature, represented by the Gravity Shell.

Spatial Curvature: This curvature is described by modifying the spatial metric: [ ds^2 = \frac{dr^2}{1 - \frac{GM}{r}} + r^2 (d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta , d\phi^2) ] where (M) is the mass of the Sun, (G) is the gravitational constant, and (r) is the radial distance from the Sun's center.

Mercury's Orbit:

Path Calculation: We use this metric to calculate Mercury's orbit. For simplicity, we'll consider Mercury's orbit in the equatorial plane ((\theta = \pi/2)), focusing on the radial and azimuthal components:

Effective Potential: In this spatial context, we define an effective potential for the orbit: [ V_{\text{eff}}(r) = -\frac{GM}{r} + \frac{L^2}{2r^2} \left(1 - \frac{GM}{r}\right) ] where (L) is the angular momentum per unit mass of Mercury.

Orbital Equation: The orbit can be described by: [ \frac{d^2 u}{d\phi^2} + u = \frac{GM}{L^2} + \frac{3GM}{c^2} u^2 ] where (u = 1/r) for convenience, and we've included the term (\frac{3GM}{c^2} u^2) to account for the additional spatial curvature effect in our model. This term corresponds to the relativistic correction in GR but is interpreted here as spatial curvature.

Calculating Precession:

Approximate Solution: We solve this differential equation approximately by treating the relativistic term as a perturbation:

The unperturbed solution is a simple ellipse, (u = \frac{GM}{L^2} (1 + e \cos \phi)), where (e) is the eccentricity.

Including the spatial curvature term, we add a small correction to this orbit. The precession per orbit due to this term can be calculated by integrating over one orbit: [ \Delta \phi_{Causal} \approx \frac{6\pi GM}{c^2 a (1 - e^2)} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{r_s}{r}\right)^{-1} ] Here, (a) is the semi-major axis of Mercury's orbit, and (r_s) is a parameter representing the spatial influence of the Sun's mass. For this calculation, we approximate (r_s) as the Schwarzschild radius of the Sun: [ r_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2} ]

Numerical Values: For Mercury:

(M \approx 1.989 \times 10^{30} , \text{kg}) (mass of the Sun)
(G \approx 6.67430 \times 10^{-11} , \text{m}^3\text{kg}^{-1}\text{s}^{-2})
(c \approx 3 \times 10^8 , \text{m/s})
(a \approx 5.79 \times 10^{10} , \text{m}) (Mercury's semi-major axis)
(e \approx 0.2056) (Mercury's eccentricity)
Plugging these into our equation: [ \Delta \phi_{Causal} \approx \frac{6\pi \cdot 6.67430 \times 10^{-11} \cdot 1.989 \times 10^{30}}{(3 \times 10^8)^2 \cdot 5.79 \times 10^{10} (1 - 0.2056^2)} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{2 \cdot 6.67430 \times 10^{-11} \cdot 1.989 \times 10^{30}}{(3 \times 10^8)^2 \cdot 5.79 \times 10^{10}}\right)^{-1} ]

Simplifying: [ \Delta \phi_{Causal} \approx 5.015 \times 10^{-7} \cdot \left(1 - 0.0000135\right)^{-1} \approx 5.015 \times 10^{-7} \cdot 1.0000135 \approx 5.015 \times 10^{-7} \text{ radians per orbit} ]

Converting to arcseconds per century: [ \Delta \phi_{Causal} \approx 5.015 \times 10^{-7} \times \left(\frac{180}{\pi} \times 3600\right) \times 415 \approx 43 \text{ arcseconds per century} ]

This calculation shows that Causal Relativity model predicts approximately the same precession as General Relativity, interpreting it as a spatial effect rather than a temporal one. Note that this is an approximation, and more precise calculations would involve higher-order terms and numerical methods.

**Implications:**  
- This interpretation might simplify the teaching and understanding of orbital mechanics by focusing on spatial effects alone.
- It could also lead to new methods for calculating or predicting the orbits of celestial bodies in complex gravitational environments.

---

**Challenges and Critiques:**  
- The model must account for the observed precision of GR's predictions without introducing inconsistencies, particularly for planets with different orbital parameters.
- Critics might argue that removing time could limit the model's ability to handle dynamic systems or interactions between multiple celestial bodies.

---

**Conclusion:**  
We've shown that the perihelion shift of planets can be conceptualized as a consequence of spatial curvature in Causal Relativity, offering an alternative explanation to the traditional GR one. This approach aligns with observational data but invites a reevaluation of how we understand orbits in a time-less universe. Further work should aim at extending this model to other orbital phenomena and complex systems.
