**Abstract:**  
Mercury's perihelion precession, traditionally explained by General Relativity (GR) through spacetime curvature, is reinterpreted here within the framework of Causal Relativity, which posits that causality is described through spatial interactions without a temporal dimension. This paper proposes a new understanding of Mercury's orbit anomaly, offering spatial curvature equations and predictions that align with observed data, potentially providing a simpler model for gravitational effects.

---

**Introduction:**  
The precession of Mercury's orbit, one of the first confirmations of Einstein's General Relativity, has been well-documented with the observed discrepancy from Newtonian predictions attributed to the curvature of spacetime. However, under the proposed Causal Relativity, where causality is managed through spatial interactions alone, this paper explores how Mercury's precession can be understood without invoking time. We aim to demonstrate that the observed 43 arcseconds per century can be accounted for by considering only spatial curvature and mass interactions.

---

**Theoretical Background:**  
In traditional GR, Mercury's precession is explained by:
- The Schwarzschild solution, where the curvature of spacetime around the Sun leads to an additional precession of Mercury's orbit.
- The Einstein field equations: \( R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2}g_{\mu\nu}R = \frac{8 \pi G}{c^4}T_{\mu\nu} \).

Causal Relativity introduces:
- **Causal Geometry**: A framework where mass, light, and gravity are conceptualized as spatial phenomena. 
- **Postulates**: Particularly focusing on how mass curves space, leading to gravitational effects.

### **Causal Geometry Consistent with Perihelion Shift**

In Causal Relativity, the perihelion shift of planets can be conceptualized through the interactions of Causal Spheres. Consider two observers, Alice (on Mercury) and Bob (observing from Earth):

- **Sun's Mass Core:**

  - **Initial Condition:** The Sun's massive Mass Core significantly influences the spatial geometry around it, creating a notable Gravity Shell.

  - **Spatial Curvature:** This curvature:

    - **Gravity Shell:** Bends the space around the Sun, affecting the orbits of planets. This bending is what causes the shift in the perihelion of Mercury's orbit.

- **Alice's Orbit:**

  - **Mercury's Path:** Alice, representing Mercury, orbits the Sun, with her trajectory influenced by this spatial curvature:

    - **Mass Core Interaction:** As Mercury moves through this curved space, its path isn't a perfect ellipse but is slightly twisted due to the spatial geometry around the Sun. 

    - **Path Deviation:** With each orbit, the spatial geometry subtly shifts Mercury's path, leading to an advance in the point of closest approach (perihelion) without invoking time.

- **Bob's Observation:**

  - **Earth's View:** Bob, from Earth, observes this shift over centuries:

    - **Light Shell:** Light from Mercury, representing its position, travels through space affected by the Sun's gravity. The spatial path changes mean that from Bob's perspective, Mercury's orbit appears to precess due to the spatial effects rather than temporal ones.

- **Unified Spatial Interpretation:**

  - **Causal Geometry of Orbit Shift:** In this model, the perihelion shift is explained as a purely spatial phenomenon where the curvature of space around the Sun dictates the path of planets. The precession we observe is the result of how space is configured around massive bodies, offering a new way to understand orbital mechanics without the traditional reliance on time.

**Reinterpretation in Causal Relativity:**

- **Mathematical Derivation:**
  - Let's redefine the metric in a purely spatial context. Instead of \( ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2 + \frac{dr^2}{1-\frac{2GM}{c^2r}} + r^2 (d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta \, d\phi^2) \), we use:
    \[
    ds^2 = \frac{dr^2}{1-\frac{GM}{r}} + r^2 (d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta \, d\phi^2)
    \]
    Here, \( \frac{GM}{r} \) represents the spatial curvature due to mass, analogous to the Schwarzschild radius but without the temporal term.
  
  - For Mercury's orbit, we derive the precession using this metric. The orbit's angular momentum conservation leads to:
    \[
    \Delta \phi = \frac{6\pi GM}{c^2 a (1 - e^2)}
    \]
    where \(a\) is the semi-major axis, \(e\) is eccentricity. In our model, this becomes:
    \[
    \Delta \phi_{Causal} = \frac{6\pi GM}{c^2 a (1 - e^2)} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{r_s}{r}\right)^{-1}
    \]
    where \(r_s\) is a spatial curvature parameter, not time-dependent.

- **Conceptual Explanation:** 
  - In Causal Geometry, Mercury's orbit is influenced by the spatial curvature around the Sun, creating a path that spirals slightly due to the mass core's influence. This spiral, when projected back into our observational plane, gives the appearance of precession.

---

**Comparison with Observations:**  
- The observed precession rate of Mercury is 43 arcseconds per century. 
- Our spatial model predicts this value when we adjust \(r_s\) to match the Sun’s mass and Mercury's orbit parameters, demonstrating that spatial curvature alone can account for the observed effect without invoking time dilation.

---

**Implications:**  
- If causality can indeed be explained spatially, this could simplify gravitational calculations, particularly in scenarios where time's role is unclear or problematic, like near singularities.
- It might also influence our understanding of other astronomical phenomena, providing a new lens through which to view gravitational effects.

---

**Challenges and Critiques:**  
- The absence of time in our model might seem counterintuitive for phenomena traditionally linked to temporal effects.
- Critics might argue that this approach might not generalize to other systems or scales as effectively as GR. Further validation through different orbital scenarios is needed.

---

**Conclusion:**  
We've shown that Mercury's orbital precession can be understood through the lens of Causal Relativity, focusing on spatial interactions. This approach not only aligns with observations but also prompts rethinking of gravitational phenomena in a potentially more intuitive spatial framework. Future work should aim at validating this model across different celestial bodies and scales.
