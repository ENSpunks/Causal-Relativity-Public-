**Abstract:**  
This paper revisits the concept of black holes through the framework of Causal Relativity, where the traditional notions of time are replaced by spatial interactions. By employing a novel spatial metric, we propose that black holes can be understood without the singularity at their core, instead suggesting that mass and energy are distributed over the event horizon, effectively resolving singularities in a purely spatial context. We utilize a new equation for spatial curvature to describe black hole phenomena, offering insights into their structure and behavior.

**Introduction:**  
Black holes, as predicted by General Relativity (GR), are regions where gravity is so strong that nothing can escape from beyond the event horizon, leading to a central singularity of infinite density. This paper reinterprets these structures within Causal Relativity, where time is not a dimension, and spatial geometry alone dictates the characteristics of a black hole. We explore how this model reshapes our understanding of black holes, proposing a new equation to describe the spatial curvature at and inside the event horizon.

---

**Theoretical Background:**  
In GR, black holes are modeled with metrics like Schwarzschild for non-rotating masses, highlighting:

- **Event Horizon:** A boundary beyond which escape is impossible.
- **Singularity:** A point of infinite density and curvature.

Causal Relativity introduces:

- **Causal Geometry:** We propose a spatial framework where the event horizon acts as a boundary of extreme spatial curvature, and the singularity is reimagined as distributed mass and energy.

### **Causal Geometry Consistent with Black Holes**

Here, we examine black holes through the interactions of Causal Spheres:

- **Alice's Journey into the Black Hole:**

  - **Initial Condition:** Alice and Bob, near a black hole, interact with each other's and the black hole's Mass Cores, Light Shells, and Gravity Shells.

  - **Approaching the Event Horizon:** 

    - **Mass Core Interaction:** Alice's path is altered by the black hole’s immense spatial curvature, her Mass Core interacting with the black hole's.

    - **Gravity Shell:** The black hole's gravity bends space, forming what appears as an event horizon but is fundamentally a spatial boundary.

    - **Light Shell:** Alice's light bends back due to this curvature; from Bob's perspective, it seems she never crosses the horizon, as light paths curve back inside.

- **Event Horizon and Singularity:**

  - **Spatial Event Horizon:** This boundary is where space curves so much that no path leads outward.

  - **Avoiding Singularity:** The spatial metric we introduce:
    \[
    ds^2 = \left(1 - \frac{r_s}{r} + \kappa \left(\frac{A_{\text{inner}} + A_{\text{outer}}}{A_{\text{total}}}\right)\right) dr^2 + r^2 (d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta \, d\phi^2)
    \]
    Here, \( r_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2} \), \( \kappa = 1 \), \( A_{\text{inner}} = A_{\text{outer}} = 4\pi r_s^2 \), and \( A_{\text{total}} = 8\pi r_s^2 \). At the event horizon, the spatial interval remains finite, suggesting no singularity:

    \[
    ds^2 = dr^2 + r_s^2 (d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta \, d\phi^2)
    \]

    - **Mass Encoding:** Mass is proposed to be encoded on the horizon's surface, potentially resolving the information paradox.

    - **Light Core:** Light within the horizon forms a dense but finite core, instead of collapsing to a point.

- **Unified Spatial Interpretation:**

  - **Causal Geometry of Black Holes:** This model suggests that black hole features are spatial phenomena. The interior is a space where traditional geometric concepts are redefined.

---

**Reinterpretation in Causal Relativity:**

- **Mathematical Derivation:**

  - The spatial metric describes the geometry around and within a black hole, ensuring finite spatial intervals even at the event horizon.

- **Conceptual Explanation:**

  - **Event Horizon as Spatial Boundary:** Seen as a limit where space curvature dictates no escape, not a temporal boundary.

  - **Singularity Resolution:** Mass distribution over the horizon avoids infinite density, with light forming a dense but finite core.

- **Potential Interpretation:**

  - **Mass Encoding:** Similar to the holographic principle, mass and information are distributed across the event horizon.

  - **Light Core:** Light forms a dense structure, providing a spatial resolution to what would be a singularity in traditional models.

---

**Comparison with Observations:**  
- This model aligns with observed gravitational effects like lensing, but reinterpreted spatially. It would need to account for phenomena like Hawking radiation in a spatial context, perhaps through quantum effects interacting with the horizon's spatial structure.

---

**Implications:**  
- Offers a new perspective on quantum gravity, suggesting information isn't lost but spatially distributed.
- Reimagines stellar end states as spatial configurations, not temporal endpoints.

---

**Challenges and Critiques:**  
- Explaining dynamic processes and energy emissions in purely spatial terms.
- Validating this model against established observations and experiments, especially regarding black hole thermodynamics.

---

**Conclusion:**  
This paper introduces a spatial-only interpretation of black holes within Causal Relativity, where the event horizon and internal structure are defined by spatial curvature. The resolution of singularities by distributing mass and energy spatially provides a novel approach to understanding these cosmic entities. Further theoretical development and observational evidence are necessary to substantiate this model.
