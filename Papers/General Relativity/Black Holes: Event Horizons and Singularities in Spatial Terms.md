**Abstract:**  
Black holes, traditionally understood as regions of spacetime with such strong gravity that nothing, not even light, can escape past the event horizon, are re-examined here through the lens of Causal Relativity. This paper proposes that black holes can be conceptualized in a purely spatial framework where the event horizon is a boundary of spatial curvature and the singularity might not occur as traditionally thought. We explore the implications of this model, including the possibility of mass encoding on the horizon and light forming a dense core.

**Introduction:**  
Black holes are one of the most fascinating predictions of General Relativity (GR), characterized by an event horizon and a central singularity. In Causal Relativity, we attempt to understand these structures without invoking time, suggesting that the extreme conditions of black holes could be described through spatial geometry alone.

---

**Theoretical Background:**  
In GR, black holes are described by:
- The Schwarzschild metric for non-rotating black holes, or the Kerr metric for rotating ones, leading to concepts like:
  - **Event Horizon**: The boundary beyond which escape is impossible.
  - **Singularity**: A point where densities and curvatures become infinite.

Causal Relativity postulates:
- **Causal Geometry**: The event horizon is a surface where spatial curvature becomes infinite from an external perspective, and the interior structure might avoid the traditional singularity.

---

**Reinterpretation in Causal Relativity:**

- **Mathematical Derivation:**
  - We use a spatial metric to describe the geometry around a black hole:
    \[
    ds^2 = \left(1 - \frac{r_s}{r}\right) dr^2 + r^2 (d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta \, d\phi^2)
    \]
    Here, \(r_s\) represents the Schwarzschild radius in spatial terms.
  
  - For the event horizon, instead of a time-like boundary, we consider it as a spatial limit where the geometry changes drastically:
    \[
    \lim_{r \to r_s} \left(1 - \frac{r_s}{r}\right) = 0
    \]
    indicating an infinite spatial curvature from outside.

- **Conceptual Explanation:**
  - **Event Horizon as Spatial Boundary**: The event horizon could be seen as a spatial surface where the mass of the black hole is encoded. Instead of time stopping, space becomes so curved that no path leads back out.

  - **Singularity Resolution**: One interpretation is that the mass doesn't converge to a point singularity but is distributed on the horizon. The light trapped inside could form a "light core," a finite but very dense region of light, rather than escaping or collapsing to an infinite density.

- **Potential Interpretation:** 
  - **Mass Encoding**: Mass might be encoded on the surface area of the event horizon, akin to the holographic principle, where all the information of the black hole is represented on its boundary.

  - **Light Core**: Light that cannot escape might accumulate, forming a highly dense structure within the horizon, potentially providing a spatial resolution to the problem of singularities by avoiding infinite density and curvature at a point.

---

**Comparison with Observations:**  
- Observations of black holes, such as their effects on surrounding matter, gravitational lensing, and the lack of observed singularities, might align with this model if we reinterpret these as spatial phenomena.

- The model would need to explain phenomena like Hawking radiation and black hole evaporation in spatial terms, possibly through quantum effects at the horizon.

---

**Implications:**  
- This could offer insights into quantum gravity by suggesting that information is not lost but spread across the horizon in a spatial manner.
- It might also provide a new way to think about the end states of stellar evolution, where the final state is a spatial configuration rather than a temporal one.

---

**Challenges and Critiques:**  
- The biggest challenge is explaining how this spatial-only model captures all the physical effects we attribute to black holes, particularly dynamic processes.
- Critics might argue that this model oversimplifies or misrepresents phenomena like event horizons and singularities, which have deep roots in spacetime topology.

---

**Conclusion:**  
This paper presents a novel perspective on black holes within Causal Relativity, where the event horizon and the interior structure are described by spatial curvature. The idea of mass encoding and a "light core" instead of a singularity provides an interesting resolution to some of GR's paradoxes. Further theoretical and observational work is required to validate or refine this spatial interpretation of black holes.
