**Abstract:**  
Cosmological redshift, traditionally explained by the expansion of the universe stretching the wavelength of light over time, is reconsidered here through the lens of Causal Relativity, where causality is managed by spatial interactions alone. This paper proposes that what we observe as redshift might be better understood as a result of spatial expansion, offering a novel framework for interpreting the cosmic scale factor and its implications on light propagation.

---

**Introduction:**  
The redshift of light from distant galaxies is one of the foundational observations supporting the Big Bang theory and the expanding universe model. In General Relativity (GR), this redshift is attributed to the expansion of spacetime itself. In Causal Relativity, we explore how this can be viewed as a spatial phenomenon where light's wavelength is stretched due to the spatial geometry expanding without the need for a temporal dimension.

---

**Theoretical Background:**  
In GR, cosmological redshift is described by:
- The Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric, where the redshift \(z\) is given by:
  \[
  1 + z = \frac{a(t_0)}{a(t_e)}
  \]
  where \(a(t)\) is the scale factor of the universe at different times \(t\), \(t_0\) is the time of observation, and \(t_e\) is the time of emission.

Causal Relativity suggests:
- **Causal Geometry**: Instead of time-dependent expansion, we consider space itself expanding, causing light wavelengths to stretch as they travel through this expanding geometry.

---

**Reinterpretation in Causal Relativity:**

- **Mathematical Derivation:**
  - We adapt the FLRW metric to a spatial-only context:
    \[
    ds^2 = a(r)^2 \left( \frac{dr^2}{1 - k r^2} + r^2 (d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta \, d\phi^2)\right)
    \]
    where \(a(r)\) represents the spatial expansion factor at a given distance \(r\) from the observer, without temporal evolution.

  - The redshift in this framework becomes:
    \[
    1 + z = \frac{a(r_0)}{a(r_e)}
    \]
    Here, \(a(r_0)\) and \(a(r_e)\) are the spatial scale factors at the observer's and emitter's positions, respectively.

- **Conceptual Explanation:**
  - In this model, light travels through an expanding space where the distance between any two points increases over the spatial dimension. This expansion of space itself stretches the wavelength of light, which we observe as redshift.

---

**Comparison with Observations:**  
- Observations of galaxy spectra showing redshift match this model if we consider the stretching of space between the observer and the light source.

- Supernova observations, used to infer the universe's expansion rate, would be reinterpreted as measuring the spatial expansion of light paths rather than time dilation.

---

**Implications:**  
- This spatial interpretation might simplify some aspects of cosmology by removing time from the explanation of redshift, potentially offering new ways to conceptualize the universe's expansion.

- It could also affect how we interpret cosmological constants or dark energy, focusing on spatial effects rather than temporal ones.

---

**Challenges and Critiques:**  
- The primary challenge is explaining dynamic processes like structure formation or the cosmic microwave background without invoking time, which might complicate certain aspects of cosmology.

- Critics might argue that this model could struggle to account for the detailed temporal aspects of the universe's history as described by GR.

---

**Conclusion:**  
We've proposed that cosmological redshift can be understood as a result of spatial expansion within Causal Relativity, where light's wavelength stretches due to the geometry of space rather than time. This approach aligns with observational data but invites a reevaluation of how we understand cosmic expansion. Further exploration should focus on how this model integrates with other cosmological phenomena and observations.
