**Abstract:**  
Gravitational redshift, typically explained by the loss of energy of photons escaping from a gravitational well, is here reinterpreted within the context of Causal Relativity, which eliminates time from the equation. We propose that what we observe as redshift can be understood as a spatial effect where the wavelength of light stretches due to spatial geometry alone. This paper explores how observations of gravitational redshift align with this new spatial interpretation.

---

**Introduction:**  
Gravitational redshift is a direct consequence of General Relativity (GR), where photons lose energy as they climb out of a gravitational field, resulting in an increase in wavelength or redshift. This has been observed in light from white dwarfs, neutron stars, and even in the Sun's spectrum. Here, we investigate how Causal Relativity can explain this phenomenon through spatial dilation rather than time dilation, offering a novel perspective on light's behavior in gravitational fields.

---

**Theoretical Background:**  
In GR, gravitational redshift is given by:
- The formula for redshift \( z \):
  \[
  z = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{2GM}{c^2 r}}} - 1
  \]
  where \(G\) is the gravitational constant, \(M\) is the mass causing the gravitational field, \(c\) is the speed of light, and \(r\) is the radial distance from the center of mass.

Causal Relativity postulates:
- **Causal Geometry**: Light's wavelength changes due to the spatial stretching caused by mass, not because of temporal effects.

---

**Reinterpretation in Causal Relativity:**

- **Mathematical Derivation:**
  - With a spatial metric of:
    \[
    ds^2 = \frac{dr^2}{1 - \frac{GM}{r}} + r^2 (d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta \, d\phi^2)
    \]
  - We can derive a spatial redshift formula where the increase in wavelength (\(\Delta \lambda\)) is due to spatial stretching:
    \[
    \Delta \lambda' = \Delta \lambda \cdot \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{2GM}{c^2 r}}} \right)
    \]
    where \(\Delta \lambda\) is the wavelength in flat space and \(\Delta \lambda'\) is the redshifted wavelength.

- **Conceptual Explanation:**
  - As light travels through regions of increasing spatial curvature, its wavelength is stretched in a manner similar to how distances are stretched in this geometry. This spatial dilation mimics the effect of time dilation in traditional interpretations.

---

**Comparison with Observations:**  
- Observations of gravitational redshift from compact objects like neutron stars or white dwarfs can be reinterpreted with this model. The prediction of an increase in wavelength due to spatial curvature should match observed data.

- Satellite experiments or astronomical observations like those of Sirius B would serve as tests for this spatial redshift model, where the redshift is due to spatial, not temporal, effects.

---

**Implications:**  
- This theory could lead to a more unified understanding of how light behaves in gravitational fields, potentially simplifying some aspects of cosmology and astrophysics.
- It might also encourage new observational techniques or interpretations, focusing on spatial rather than temporal aspects.

---

**Challenges and Critiques:**  
- The removal of time from the explanation might be contentious, as time is deeply ingrained in our understanding of redshift.
- Critics might question how this model accounts for the energy conservation of photons, traditionally explained by energy loss over time.

---

**Conclusion:**  
We've proposed that gravitational redshift can be conceptualized as a spatial phenomenon within Causal Relativity, where the stretching of light's wavelength is due to spatial geometry rather than temporal effects. This approach aligns with known observations but challenges conventional interpretations. Further work should focus on detailed comparisons with GR predictions and potential new observational tests.
