**Abstract:**  
Frame-dragging, or the Lense-Thirring effect, where rotating masses drag spacetime around them, is traditionally described by General Relativity (GR) using time and space together. This paper introduces a reinterpretation within the framework of Causal Relativity, where causality is understood through spatial interactions alone. We explore how the rotational effects of mass can still influence the spatial geometry without the need for a temporal component, offering a new perspective on this intriguing gravitational phenomenon.

---

**Introduction:**  
Frame-dragging has been experimentally verified, particularly with the Gravity Probe B experiment, showing how Earth's rotation affects the orientation of gyroscopes in orbit. In GR, this effect arises from the coupling of space and time in the presence of rotating mass. Here, we propose that in Causal Relativity, frame-dragging can be explained as a purely spatial effect, where the rotation of a mass core influences the surrounding spatial geometry.

---

**Theoretical Background:**  
In GR, frame-dragging is described by:
- The Kerr metric for rotating black holes, or more generally, the effects are encapsulated in the off-diagonal terms of the metric tensor, leading to:
  \[
  \Delta \theta = \frac{4GJ}{c^2 r^2}
  \]
  where \(J\) is the angular momentum of the mass, \(G\) is the gravitational constant, \(c\) is the speed of light, and \(r\) is the distance from the center of the rotating mass.

Causal Relativity suggests:
- **Causal Geometry**: Instead of dragging time and space, we propose that rotating mass only drags space, altering the spatial paths of objects and light around it.

---

**Reinterpretation in Causal Relativity:**

- **Mathematical Derivation:**
  - We adapt the Kerr metric to our spatial-only context, focusing on how the rotation of mass induces a spatial twist:
    \[
    ds^2 = \left(1 - \frac{GM}{r}\right) dr^2 + r^2 \left(d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta \, d\phi^2 - \frac{2GJ \sin^2\theta}{c^2 r^3} \, dr \, d\phi\right)
    \]
  - The frame-dragging effect can then be expressed in terms of spatial angular changes:
    \[
    \Delta \theta_{Causal} = \frac{4GJ}{c^2 r^2} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{r_s}{r}\right)^{-1}
    \]
    where \(r_s\) represents the spatial influence of mass on curvature.

- **Conceptual Explanation:**
  - In this model, the rotation of a mass creates a 'vortex' in space around it, where spatial coordinates are dragged in the direction of rotation, affecting the paths of objects or light without invoking time.

---

**Comparison with Observations:**  
- Observations from experiments like Gravity Probe B or the precession of satellite orbits around Earth can be re-examined. The spatial twist in our model would predict the same deviations in gyroscope orientation or orbital paths as observed.

- Future experiments might focus on how this spatial dragging affects light propagation around rotating bodies, potentially offering new ways to measure this effect.

---

**Implications:**  
- This reinterpretation could simplify the understanding of how rotating masses affect their surroundings, potentially leading to new methods for studying rotational dynamics in space.

- It might also influence our approach to gravitational wave detection from rotating systems by considering only spatial perturbations.

---

**Challenges and Critiques:**  
- The primary challenge is to demonstrate that all effects traditionally attributed to frame-dragging can be explained without time, especially in complex systems like binary black holes.

- Critics might argue that removing time from the equation could miss out on some dynamic aspects of frame-dragging observed in GR.

---

**Conclusion:**  
We've proposed a spatial reinterpretation of frame-dragging within Causal Relativity, where the effects of rotating mass are understood through spatial geometry alone. This model aligns with current observations but offers a potentially more straightforward conceptual framework. Further theoretical and empirical work is needed to fully validate this approach, particularly in scenarios involving high angular momentum.
