**Abstract:**  
Frame-dragging, or the Lense-Thirring effect, where rotating masses drag spacetime around them, is traditionally described by General Relativity (GR) using time and space together. This paper introduces a reinterpretation within the framework of Causal Relativity, where causality is understood through spatial interactions alone. We explore how the rotational effects of mass can still influence the spatial geometry without the need for a temporal component, offering a new perspective on this intriguing gravitational phenomenon.

---

**Introduction:**  
Frame-dragging has been experimentally verified, particularly with the Gravity Probe B experiment, showing how Earth's rotation affects the orientation of gyroscopes in orbit. In GR, this effect arises from the coupling of space and time in the presence of rotating mass. Here, we propose that in Causal Relativity, frame-dragging can be explained as a purely spatial effect, where the rotation of a mass core influences the surrounding spatial geometry.

---

**Theoretical Background:**  
In GR, frame-dragging is described by:
- The Kerr metric for rotating black holes, or more generally, the effects are encapsulated in the off-diagonal terms of the metric tensor, leading to:
  \[
  \Delta \theta = \frac{4GJ}{c^2 r^2}
  \]
  where \(J\) is the angular momentum of the mass, \(G\) is the gravitational constant, \(c\) is the speed of light, and \(r\) is the distance from the center of the rotating mass.

Causal Relativity suggests:
- **Causal Geometry**: Instead of dragging time and space, we propose that rotating mass only drags space, altering the spatial paths of objects and light around it.

### **Causal Geometry Consistent with Frame-Dragging**

In Causal Relativity, frame-dragging can be conceptualized through the interactions of Causal Spheres. Consider two observers, Alice (in orbit around a rotating body) and Bob (on the rotating body itself):

- **Bob's Rotating Mass:**

  - **Initial Condition:** Bob is on a rotating mass (e.g., Earth or a rotating black hole), with his Mass Core spinning. This rotation induces a spatial twist around him, represented by his Gravity Shell.

  - **Spatial Vortex:** As Bob's Mass Core rotates:

    - **Gravity Shell:** The Gravity Shell around Bob twists space, creating what can be visualized as a vortex in space. This twist affects the spatial geometry around Bob, pulling or dragging the surrounding space in the direction of rotation.

    - **Mass Core Influence:** The rotating mass influences the spatial fabric, bending it in a way that objects or light passing nearby are affected by this spatial drag.

- **Alice's Orbit:**

  - **Orbital Motion:** Alice orbits around this rotating mass. Her trajectory through space is influenced by this spatial vortex:

    - **Light Shell:** Alice's Light Shell, representing the light she emits or receives, would follow paths that are not straight but are instead curved or twisted due to the spatial geometry altered by Bob's rotating mass.

    - **Spatial Drag:** From Alice's perspective, her path or the path of any object she observes is not just curved by gravity but also dragged along by the rotation of the mass below. This spatial drag is what we traditionally interpret as frame-dragging, but here it's purely a spatial phenomenon.

- **Unified Spatial Interpretation:**

  - **Causal Geometry of Frame-Dragging:** In this model, frame-dragging is seen as space itself being twisted by rotating mass. The spatial paths of objects or light are altered in this twisted space, leading to observable effects like precession in orbits or the alignment of gyroscopes without invoking time.

**Insert this section immediately after the "Theoretical Background" section** in your paper. This placement will help to transition from the theoretical concepts of GR to how Causal Relativity reimagines frame-dragging in purely spatial terms.

**Reinterpretation in Causal Relativity:**

- **Mathematical Derivation:**
  - We adapt the Kerr metric to our spatial-only context, focusing on how the rotation of mass induces a spatial twist:
    \[
    ds^2 = \left(1 - \frac{GM}{r}\right) dr^2 + r^2 \left(d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta \, d\phi^2 - \frac{2GJ \sin^2\theta}{c^2 r^3} \, dr \, d\phi\right)
    \]
  - The frame-dragging effect can then be expressed in terms of spatial angular changes:
    \[
    \Delta \theta_{Causal} = \frac{4GJ}{c^2 r^2} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{r_s}{r}\right)^{-1}
    \]
    where \(r_s\) represents the spatial influence of mass on curvature.

- **Conceptual Explanation:**
  - In this model, the rotation of a mass creates a 'vortex' in space around it, where spatial coordinates are dragged in the direction of rotation, affecting the paths of objects or light without invoking time.

---

**Comparison with Observations:**  
- Observations from experiments like Gravity Probe B or the precession of satellite orbits around Earth can be re-examined. The spatial twist in our model would predict the same deviations in gyroscope orientation or orbital paths as observed.

- Future experiments might focus on how this spatial dragging affects light propagation around rotating bodies, potentially offering new ways to measure this effect.

---

**Implications:**  
- This reinterpretation could simplify the understanding of how rotating masses affect their surroundings, potentially leading to new methods for studying rotational dynamics in space.

- It might also influence our approach to gravitational wave detection from rotating systems by considering only spatial perturbations.

---

**Challenges and Critiques:**  
- The primary challenge is to demonstrate that all effects traditionally attributed to frame-dragging can be explained without time, especially in complex systems like binary black holes.

- Critics might argue that removing time from the equation could miss out on some dynamic aspects of frame-dragging observed in GR.

---

**Conclusion:**  
We've proposed a spatial reinterpretation of frame-dragging within Causal Relativity, where the effects of rotating mass are understood through spatial geometry alone. This model aligns with current observations but offers a potentially more straightforward conceptual framework. Further theoretical and empirical work is needed to fully validate this approach, particularly in scenarios involving high angular momentum.
