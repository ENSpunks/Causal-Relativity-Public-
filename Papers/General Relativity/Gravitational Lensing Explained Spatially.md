**Abstract:**  
Gravitational lensing, where light from distant objects is bent by the gravity of massive celestial bodies, has been a cornerstone for validating General Relativity (GR). This paper presents an alternative interpretation within the framework of Causal Relativity, where causality is defined through spatial interactions without invoking time. We explore how the bending of light can be understood as a purely spatial effect due to the curvature of space around mass, offering a new perspective that aligns with existing observations.

---

**Introduction:**  
Gravitational lensing is traditionally explained by GR, where massive objects curve spacetime, causing light to follow curved paths. This phenomenon has been observed in various forms, from the deflection of starlight during solar eclipses to the creation of multiple images of galaxies. Here, we reinterpret this effect within Causal Relativity, where light's path is influenced by the spatial curvature around a mass without the temporal dimension.

---

**Theoretical Background:**  
In GR, gravitational lensing is described by:
- The geodesic equation for light in curved spacetime, resulting in the formula for light deflection:
  \[
  \theta \approx \frac{4GM}{c^2 b}
  \]
  where \( \theta \) is the angle of deflection, \(G\) is the gravitational constant, \(M\) is the mass of the lensing object, \(c\) is the speed of light, and \(b\) is the impact parameter.

Causal Relativity posits:
- **Causal Geometry**: Light travels along spatial paths dictated by the curvature caused by mass, with no temporal component influencing its path.

### **Causal Geometry Consistent with Gravitational Lensing**

In Causal Relativity, gravitational lensing can be conceptualized through the interactions of Causal Spheres. Consider two observers, Alice (observing from Earth) and Bob (near a massive lensing object):

- **Bob's Mass Core:**

  - **Initial Condition:** Bob is located near or within a massive object like a galaxy cluster, which has a significant Mass Core. This mass causes a spatial curvature described by his Gravity Shell.

  - **Spatial Curvature:** The presence of Bob's Mass Core:

    - **Gravity Shell:** Curves the space around it, creating a spatial geometry where paths are no longer straight but bent around the mass. This curvature is what we would traditionally attribute to gravitational lensing.

- **Alice's Observation:**

  - **Light from Distant Source:** Alice observes light from a distant star or galaxy (Light Shell) that must travel through the space influenced by Bob's Gravity Shell:

    - **Light Shell:** As this light approaches the mass, its path is bent due to the spatial geometry. From Alice's viewpoint, the light doesn't travel in a straight line but follows the curvature of space around Bob's mass, leading to phenomena like the bending of light, creation of multiple images, or magnification of the source.

    - **Spatial Bending:** The bending of light is thus explained as a purely spatial effect where light follows the shortest path through the curved space, which appears to us as a deflection.

- **Unified Spatial Interpretation:**

  - **Causal Geometry of Lensing:** In this model, what we observe as gravitational lensing is the result of light adapting to the spatial geometry around a massive body. The spatial curvature, rather than spacetime curvature, dictates the path of light, providing a new way to visualize and understand gravitational lensing without the need for temporal considerations.

**Reinterpretation in Causal Relativity:**

- **Mathematical Derivation:**
  - In Causal Geometry, we modify the metric to reflect spatial curvature alone:
    \[
    ds^2 = \frac{dr^2}{1-\frac{GM}{r}} + r^2 (d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta \, d\phi^2)
    \]
  - The deflection angle in this model can be derived from the spatial path light must follow around a mass core:
    \[
    \theta_{Causal} \approx \frac{4GM}{c^2 b} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{r_s}{r}\right)^{-1}
    \]
    where \(r_s\) is a parameter representing the spatial influence of the mass on curvature.

- **Conceptual Explanation:**
  - Light, as a spatial phenomenon, is bent by the geometry of space around a mass. The "shells" of causal geometry dictate that light must follow paths that curve around the mass core, akin to how a ball would roll on a curved surface.

---

**Comparison with Observations:**  
- Observational data from lensing events like those seen in galaxy clusters or the Einstein Cross can be matched by this spatial model by adjusting \(r_s\) to fit the known mass distributions.
- The model predicts that the degree of bending should correlate directly with the mass's spatial curvature, consistent with current observations.

---

**Implications:**  
- This spatial perspective could simplify the teaching and understanding of gravitational lensing, focusing solely on spatial geometry.
- It might also suggest new ways to study dark matter distribution, as the bending of light would be a direct result of spatial curvature, potentially offering new observational techniques.

---

**Challenges and Critiques:**  
- The removal of time from the equation might face scrutiny regarding how causality is maintained in dynamic systems where time traditionally plays a role.
- Critics might argue that this model could struggle with complex lensing scenarios where temporal effects in GR provide nuanced explanations.

---

**Conclusion:**  
We have shown that gravitational lensing can be conceptualized through spatial curvature alone in the framework of Causal Relativity. This approach not only conforms to existing observational evidence but also potentially simplifies the underlying physics of light bending. Further work should explore this model's predictive power in more complex lensing scenarios and its integration with other spatial interpretations of relativity.
