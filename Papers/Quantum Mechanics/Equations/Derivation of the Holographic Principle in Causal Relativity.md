#### **Abstract**

This paper explores the holographic principle within the framework of Causal Relativity, where time is not considered as a dimension but causality is maintained through spatial interactions. We propose a causality-based interpretation of the holographic principle, particularly focusing on how information can be encoded in spatial configurations devoid of temporal evolution. By refining the traditional area-to-volume encoding through curvature and boundary thickness, we provide new insights into black holes, cosmology, and the resolution of singularities.

#### **Introduction**

The holographic principle posits that all the information contained within a volume of space can be described by a theory defined on its boundary surface. Traditional interpretations rely on temporal dynamics to explain information encoding. In Causal Relativity, where causality is fundamentally spatial, we reconceptualize the principle by investigating how spatial boundaries encode information in curved spacetime, particularly at black hole event horizons or the initial state of the universe.

#### **Theoretical Framework**

- **Causal Spheres:** In this model, physical interactions occur within spatial constructs where causality is maintained through curvature and boundary interactions.  
- **Information Encoding:** Information is spatially encoded on causal boundaries, and the encoding capacity is influenced by curvature and quantum corrections.

#### **Holographic Principle in Traditional Context**

**Original Formulation:**

1. **Entropy Bound:** The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy for a black hole:
   \[
   S_{BH} = \frac{A}{4l_P^2},
   \]
   where \(A\) is the horizon area, and \(l_P\) is the Planck length.

2. **Holographic Bound:** The information content of a region of space is no greater than what can be encoded on its boundary:
   \[
   I \leq \frac{A}{4l_P^2}.
   \]

---

#### **Refinement in Causal Relativity**

In Causal Relativity, spatial causality introduces additional encoding capacity due to boundary curvature and thickness.

##### **1. Curvature and Boundary Thickness**

For curved spatial boundaries, the area available for encoding differs between the **outermost boundary** and an effective **inner area** determined by curvature. The difference is proportional to the Gaussian curvature \(K\) of the boundary:
\[
A_{\text{external}} - A_{\text{internal}} \propto \int K \, dA.
\]

This curvature-induced difference defines an effective **boundary thickness**:
\[
\text{Thickness} \approx \frac{R_{\text{external}} - R_{\text{internal}}}{l_P},
\]
where \(R_{\text{external}}\) and \(R_{\text{internal}}\) are radii of curvature.

The encoding capacity is refined as:
\[
I_{\text{causal}} = \frac{A}{4l_P^2} \left(1 + \frac{\Delta R}{l_P}\right),
\]
where \(\Delta R = R_{\text{external}} - R_{\text{internal}}\) accounts for the curvature-induced thickness.

---

##### **2. Black Hole Event Horizon**

In traditional black hole physics, information is encoded strictly on the event horizon. In Causal Relativity, the horizon acts as a causal boundary with additional spatial layers.

**Encoding Capacity in Causal Relativity:**
\[
I_{\text{BH, causal}} = \frac{A}{4l_P^2} \left(1 + \frac{\Delta A}{A}\right),
\]
where \(\Delta A = A_{\text{external}} - A_{\text{internal}}\) is the curvature-induced area difference.

This additional capacity resolves singularities by allowing information to encode bi-directionally across the boundary, accounting for both external and internal areas.

---

##### **3. Big Bang and Initial Information State**

At the beginning of the universe, information is encoded on the initial causal sphere. Unlike traditional models, where temporal evolution plays a role, the encoding capacity in Causal Relativity depends on the curvature and thickness of this initial spatial boundary.

**Causal Relativity Equation for the Big Bang:**
\[
I_{\text{universe, initial}} = \frac{A_{\text{initial}}}{4l_P^2} \left(1 + f(K)\right),
\]
where \(f(K)\) scales with the curvature:
\[
f(K) = \frac{\int K \, dA}{A}.
\]

This model suggests that the universe's initial state was a holographic encoding on a curved spatial boundary, consistent with causality.

---

#### **Comparison and Implications**

- **Comparison with Traditional Models:**  
  The causal approach refines the holographic principle by incorporating curvature and boundary thickness, extending the encoding capacity and addressing singularities.  

- **Implications:**  
  1. **Black Holes:** The curvature-induced correction resolves the information paradox by providing additional encoding capacity for the singularity.  
  2. **Cosmology:** The universe's initial information state can be fully described as a holographic encoding on the initial causal sphere, avoiding singularities.  

---

#### **Conclusion**

By integrating curvature and boundary thickness into the holographic principle, we have derived a causality-based framework for information encoding. This refined approach provides a deeper understanding of black holes, cosmology, and the role of causality in information theory. Future work could explore observational tests and quantum corrections to the causal boundary.
