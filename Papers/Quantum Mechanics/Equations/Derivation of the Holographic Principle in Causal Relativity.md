#### **Abstract:**

This paper explores the holographic principle within the framework of Causal Relativity, where time is not considered as a dimension but causality is maintained through spatial interactions. We propose a causality-based interpretation of the holographic principle, particularly focusing on how information can be encoded in spatial configurations devoid of temporal evolution, and extend this to black holes and the Big Bang scenario.

#### **Introduction:**

The holographic principle posits that all of the information contained in a volume of space can be described by a theory that operates on its boundary. Traditional interpretations use temporal dynamics to explain how information is encoded. In Causal Relativity, we reconceptualize this principle by looking at how spatial causality dictates information encoding, particularly at boundaries like black hole event horizons or the initial state of the universe.

#### **Theoretical Framework:**

- **Causal Spheres:** In this model, all physical interactions occur within spatial constructs where causality is maintained through spatial curvature and interactions.

- **Information Encoding:** Information is encoded on the surfaces of these causal spheres, reflecting the holographic nature of space. 

#### **Holographic Principle in Traditional Context:**

**Original Formulation:**

- **Entropy Bound:** The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy bound for a black hole:
  \[ S_{BH} \leq \frac{A}{4l_P^2} \]
  where \(A\) is the area of the event horizon, and \(l_P\) is the Planck length.

- **Holographic Bound:** The information content of a region of space is no more than what can be encoded on its boundary:
  \[ I \leq \frac{A}{4l_P^2} \]

#### **Derivation of Causal Relativity Equations for Holographic Principle:**

##### **1. Causal Information Encoding:**

**Causal Relativity Interpretation:**

- **Spatial Causality:** Information is encoded spatially on both sides of an area, particularly at boundaries where space curves significantly, like black hole event horizons.

**Causal Relativity Equation:**

\[ I_{\text{causal}} = \frac{A_{\text{causal}}}{2l_P^2} \]

- **Derivation Logic:** In Causal Relativity, since time is not a factor, we assume that information can be encoded bi-directionally across the boundary due to the spatial nature of causality. Here, \(A_{\text{causal}}\) is the area of the causal boundary, and the factor of 2 accounts for information encoding on both sides of this boundary.

##### **2. Black Hole Event Horizon in Causal Relativity:**

**Traditional Black Hole Entropy:**

\[ S_{BH} = \frac{A}{4l_P^2} \]

**Causal Relativity Black Hole Entropy:**

\[ S_{BH,\text{causal}} = \frac{A_{\text{causal}}}{2l_P^2} \]

- **Derivation Logic:** The event horizon in causal terms acts as a spatial boundary where causality dictates that information can be stored both internally and externally to the horizon, thus doubling the traditional information capacity.

##### **3. Big Bang and Initial Information State:**

**Causal Big Bang:**

- **Initial Information:** At the beginning of the universe, all information is spatially encoded on a causal sphere representing the initial state.

**Causal Relativity Equation:**

\[ I_{\text{universe, initial}} = \frac{A_{\text{initial}}}{2l_P^2} \]

- **Derivation Logic:** The Big Bang is conceptualized as an expansion from a spatial configuration where all information is encoded on the surface of the initial causal sphere. This initial state, devoid of temporal evolution, still adheres to spatial causality principles.

#### **Comparison and Implications:**

- **Comparison with Traditional Models:** The causal approach maintains the holographic principle's core idea but extends it to include spatial causality. This could potentially solve information paradoxes by allowing information to exist on both sides of a causal boundary.

- **Implications:** 
  - **Black Holes:** The increased information capacity might explain how black holes manage to preserve all information they absorb without losing it to a singularity.
  - **Cosmology:** The universe's information content from the Big Bang could be understood as a spatially encoded hologram, where the volume's information is fully described by its initial surface.

#### **Conclusion:**

We've derived a causality-based version of the holographic principle that does not use time as a variable, instead focusing on how spatial interactions encode information. This approach provides a novel perspective on information in physics, particularly at cosmological scales and in extreme environments like black holes, suggesting that the universe's information might be inherently spatial in its causal structure.

This paper invites further exploration into how causality can fundamentally affect our understanding of information in physics, potentially leading to new experimental or observational tests of these concepts.
