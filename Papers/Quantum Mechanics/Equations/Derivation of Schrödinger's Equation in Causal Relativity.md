#### **Abstract:**

This paper explores the reformulation of the Schrödinger equation within the framework of Causal Relativity, where traditional time-dependent dynamics are replaced by spatial causality interactions. We derive a new form of the Schrödinger equation, apply it to a known quantum mechanical problem, and compare the results with traditional solutions to validate the causality-based approach.

#### **Introduction:**

Quantum mechanics traditionally uses time-dependent evolution to describe particle behavior. Here, we reimagine this framework by integrating Causal Relativity, which focuses on spatial causality rather than temporal progression. The goal is to derive a causality-based Schrödinger equation, apply it to the problem of a particle in a spherical well, and compare the outcomes with standard quantum mechanics.

#### **Theoretical Framework:**

- **Causal Spheres:** In Causal Relativity, physical entities exist within spatial constructs called causal spheres, where causality is maintained through spatial interactions rather than temporal ones.

- **Causal Relativity Equations:** We use the spatial causal interval and mass-energy equivalence from Causal Relativity to reformulate quantum mechanics.

#### **Derivation of the Causal Schrödinger Equation:**

**Traditional Time-Dependent Schrödinger Equation:**
\[ i\hbar \frac{\partial \psi(\mathbf{r}, t)}{\partial t} = \hat{H} \psi(\mathbf{r}, t) \]

**Causal Relativity Interpretation:**

- **Time Elimination:** Since time is not an independent variable, we transform the temporal derivative into a spatial causality derivative.

- **Hamiltonian in Spatial Causality:** The Hamiltonian now describes energy in terms of spatial interactions:
  \[ \hat{H}_{\text{causal}} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2_{\text{causal}} + V(\mathbf{r}) \]

**Causal Schrödinger Equation:**

\[ \hat{H}_{\text{causal}} \psi(\mathbf{r}) = E_{\text{causal}} \psi(\mathbf{r}) \]

- **Derivation Logic:** Here, \( \nabla^2_{\text{causal}} \) represents a spatial operator that accounts for how causality spreads within the spatial configuration of the system. \(E_{\text{causal}}\) is the energy eigenvalue in this causality framework.

#### **Application to a Known Problem: Particle in a Spherical Well**

**Setup:**

- **Spherical Potential Well:** 
  \[
  V(\mathbf{r}) = 
  \begin{cases} 
  0, & \text{if } r \leq R \\
  \infty, & \text{if } r > R 
  \end{cases}
  \]

**Traditional Solution:**

- The energy eigenvalues are:
  \[ E_n = \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \left(\frac{n\pi}{R}\right)^2 \]
- With wave functions:
  \[ \psi(\mathbf{r}) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2\pi R}} \frac{\sin\left(\frac{n\pi r}{R}\right)}{r} \]

**Causal Relativity Solution:**

- **Spatial Causality:** We reinterpret the Laplacian in terms of spatial causality, leading to similar spatial solutions but under a different conceptual framework where spatial interactions govern causality.

- **Energy Levels:** By solving the causal Schrödinger equation, we find:
  \[ E_{n,\text{causal}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \left(\frac{n\pi}{R_{\text{causal}}}\right)^2 \]
  where \( R_{\text{causal}} \) reflects the size of the causal sphere, which might differ slightly due to spatial curvature effects.

- **Wave Function:** The form remains similar but is interpreted through the lens of spatial causality:
  \[ \psi_{\text{causal}}(\mathbf{r}) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2\pi R_{\text{causal}}}} \frac{\sin\left(\frac{n\pi r}{R_{\text{causal}}}\right)}{r} \]

#### **Comparison:**

- **Energy Levels:** The energy levels match traditional quantum mechanics, indicating that the causality-based approach reproduces known results but with a spatial causality interpretation.

- **Wave Function:** The spatial distribution of probability remains the same, suggesting that causality does not change the probabilistic nature but redefines how these probabilities are understood in terms of spatial interactions.

- **Causality Implications:** The causal approach might offer new insights into phenomena like entanglement or quantum tunneling by emphasizing spatial causality over temporal evolution.

#### **Conclusion:**

We have successfully derived and applied a causality-based Schrödinger equation that aligns with traditional quantum mechanics results for a simple system. This suggests that Causal Relativity can be a valid conceptual framework for quantum mechanics, providing new interpretations and possibly new predictions in more complex scenarios. Further work should explore dynamic spatial causality, interactions between causal spheres, and experimental validations.
