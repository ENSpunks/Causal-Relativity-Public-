### Alice and Bob Thought Experiment in Causal Relativity Framework

**Setup:**

- **Alice's Causal Sphere**: 
  - **Mass Core**: Composed of quantum spheres (quanta) with all quantum properties but described in spatial terms. Alice's mass causes space to curve.
  - **Light Sphere**: Made of photons, these interact spatially with her mass core and the external environment.
  - **Energy**: Integrated within her mass and light spheres, influencing spatial interactions.

- **Bob's Causal Sphere**: 
  - Bob has his own mass, light, and energy spheres, interacting with Alice's causal sphere.

**Experiment:**

1. **Initial State:**
   - **Alice's Quantum Spheres**: Within Alice's mass core, quantum causal spheres (like atoms) exist. Each atom has:
     - **Nucleus Core**: Composed of proton and neutron spheres.
     - **Electron Sphere**: Surrounding the nucleus, representing the electron cloud.

2. **Interaction with Bob's Light:**
   - **Bob's Light**: Quantized photons from Bob's light sphere interact with Alice's mass core in space.

3. **Spatial Interaction Dynamics:**

   - **Light Absorption and Reflection**: 
     - Some of Bob's light gets absorbed by Alice's mass core due to the curvature of space around Alice (caused by her mass). This absorption is due to the spatial configuration where the light photons enter Alice's quantum causal spheres.
     - The rest is reflected based on this same curvature, altering the path of light in space.

   - **Mass Increase**: 
     - The absorbed light (energy) increases the density of Alice's mass core through \(E=mc^2\) in a spatial context, causing further spatial curvature or "gravitational" influence.

4. **Quantum Effects Within Alice's Mass Core:**

   - **Superposition and Collapse**: 
     - An 'Atom' within Alice's mass core, initially in a superposition state, interacts with Bob's light. This interaction, purely spatial, causes the wave function of the atom to collapse to a specific location within the spatial structure of Alice's mass core. This can be seen as a spatial determination of the atom's state rather than a temporal one.

   - **Electron Interaction**: 
     - The absorbed photon energy affects the electron sphere of the atom. According to the laws of physics like electromagnetism and thermodynamics (interpreted spatially), the atom might emit light if the energy exceeds what can be contained spatially within the electron configuration.

5. **Outcome:**

   - **Light Emission**: If the energy absorbed leads to a photon emission from the atom within Alice's mass core:
     - **Escape**: If this light escapes Alice's mass curvature, it reduces Alice's mass (as energy is converted back to light, decreasing the mass via \(E=mc^2\) in reverse).
     - **Propagation**: This emitted light becomes part of Alice's light sphere, propagating at the speed of light relative to Alice's causal sphere, which is now slightly less massive due to the energy release.

**Conclusion:**

- This thought experiment illustrates how causal relativity could reinterpret quantum mechanics and relativity in terms of spatial interactions alone:
  - **Quantum mechanics** (superposition, wave function collapse) is described by spatial configurations and interactions within causal spheres.
  - **Relativistic effects** like light bending and mass-energy conversion are seen through spatial curvature and interaction rather than time evolution.

This model suggests a universe where causality is mediated through spatial interactions, potentially simplifying or reinterpreting complex phenomena like quantum entanglement or particle decay within a purely spatial framework. However, this requires a comprehensive rethinking of how we understand these phenomena, likely involving new mathematical and conceptual frameworks to ensure consistency with observed physics.
