Here's a thought experiment involving Alice and Bob with Maxwell's equations and the concept of Causal Spheres in Causal Relativity:

### **Alice and Bob's Causal Sphere Thought Experiment with Photon Propagation**

**Setting:**

- **Alice**: Represents a causal sphere with mass (m), light (l), and gravity (g), situated in space.  
- **Bob**: Another causal sphere with similar components, some distance from Alice.  
- **Photon Alice (A-Photon)**: A single photon emitted from Alice's mass.

**Photon Emission from Alice:**

- **Quantum Mechanics in Spatial Terms**: Alice's mass contains quanta that, when excited, release photons. This process reflects the conservation of energy and quantum mechanics, where an electron transitions to a lower energy state, releasing energy as a photon. 

- **Release of A-Photon**: Upon emission, A-Photon escapes the curvature caused by Alice's mass and begins to propagate outward. In Causal Relativity, this photon is part of Alice's light shell, moving at the speed of causality, which is synonymous with the speed of light in this context, 'c'.

**A-Photon's Journey:**

- **Time Experience**: From A-Photon's perspective, once released, it does not experience time due to traveling at the speed of causality. This means from the photon's perspective, the journey from emission at Alice's causal sphere to interaction with Bob's causal sphere is instantaneous. There's no "time" for the photon; its path through space is immediate.

- **Spatial Propagation**: In vacuum, A-Photon propagates through space as an electromagnetic wave, composed of oscillating electric (E) and magnetic (B) fields perpendicular to each other and to the direction of propagation. This is governed by Maxwell's equations. 

  - **Maxwell's Equations** dictate:
    - **Faraday's Law**: \(\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}\)
    - **Ampere's Law with Maxwell's addition**: \(\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J} + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}\)

  These equations show how an electric field wave generates a magnetic field, which in turn generates an electric field, perpetuating through space with no need for time in the photon's frame. This phenomenon is known as **electromagnetic wave propagation**. 

- **Causality of Wave Propagation**: In this spatial context, the propagation of these waves doesn't require time; it's the causality where one wave induces the next in space. The electric wave causes a magnetic wave, which then causes an electric wave, and so on, without temporal progression.

**Characteristics of A-Photon:**

- **Frequency, Intensity, Wavelength**: These properties of A-Photon carry information about Alice's atomic structure from which it was emitted. The energy released (E = hf where h is Planck's constant and f is frequency) reflects the energy difference in Alice's atomic transitions. 

- **Energy Conservation**: The mass of Alice decreases slightly (E = mc^2), converting into the energy of the photon, maintaining the total energy of the system without violating conservation laws.

**Interaction with Bob's Causal Sphere:**

- **Light Shell Interaction**: When A-Photon approaches Bob's causal sphere, their light shells interact. The waves can:
  - **Overlap**: In space, electromagnetic waves can occupy the same volume, allowing for interference patterns if they coincide in phase.
  - **Interact**: However, photons do not interact with each other directly; they pass through each other.

- **Photon's Fate at Bob's Causal Sphere**:
  - **Reflection, Refraction, Absorption**: A-Photon can:
    - Be reflected if it hits Bob's mass core at an angle, changing its direction but not its energy.
    - Be refracted, bending as it passes through a medium or due to spatial curvature around Bob's mass.
    - Be absorbed by Bob's mass core, where its energy excites an electron, potentially increasing Bob's internal energy or even slightly increasing his mass, adhering to E = mc^2.

**Unified Causal Sphere:**

- **Combined Effects**: When considering both Alice and Bob's causal spheres together, their combined mass, light, and gravity create a singular causal sphere where their total energy and gravitational influence are summed. This scenario illustrates how their interactions affect spatial dynamics, creating a more complex gravitational landscape and energy distribution without the need for temporal evolution.

This thought experiment highlights how Causal Relativity can describe light propagation, quantum effects, and gravitational interactions in a spatial-only framework, where causality is governed by spatial interactions rather than temporal ones.
