#### **Abstract:**

This paper details the derivation of the laws of thermodynamics within the context of Causal Relativity, where traditional temporal dynamics are reimagined through spatial interactions. We adapt the first, second, and third laws of thermodynamics to fit into a universe where time is not a dimension, but causality is maintained through spatial configurations of mass, light, and gravity. 

#### **Introduction:**

Thermodynamics deals with energy and its transformations, traditionally relying on the passage of time to explain phenomena like heat transfer, entropy increase, and the approach to absolute zero. In Causal Relativity, we propose that these processes can be described by spatial interactions among causal spheres, where 'time' is replaced by causality through spatial energy distribution.

#### **Theoretical Framework:**

- **Causal Spheres:** Entities (like Alice and Bob) are described by spheres where mass, light, and gravity interact spatially. Energy transfer, work, and changes in entropy are conceptualized as spatial phenomena.

#### **First Law of Thermodynamics:**

**Original Form:**
\[ \Delta U = Q - W \]

**Derivation in Causal Relativity:**

- **Internal Energy (U):** In a spatial context, internal energy is the total energy content within a causal sphere, influenced by its mass and the spatial distribution of energy.

- **Heat (Q) and Work (W):**
  - **Heat Transfer:** Traditionally, heat transfer involves energy moving from one system to another over time. In Causal Relativity, we consider this as a spatial transfer of energy density, \(\Delta Q_{\text{space}}\). This transfer is due to spatial interactions between causal spheres where energy redistributes to achieve a new equilibrium.

  - **Work:** Work done in a system usually involves changes over time. Here, work is redefined as the spatial reconfiguration of energy, \(\Delta W_{\text{space}}\), which might involve altering the spatial curvature or density distribution within or between causal spheres.

**Causal Relativity Equation:**

\[ \Delta U = \Delta Q_{\text{space}} - \Delta W_{\text{space}} \]

- **Derivation Logic:** The equation reflects that changes in internal energy are due to spatial energy exchanges, where work done (spatial rearrangement) reduces the system's internal energy unless compensated by heat (spatial energy transfer).

#### **Second Law of Thermodynamics:**

**Original Form:**
\[ dS = \frac{dQ}{T} \]

**Derivation in Causal Relativity:**

- **Entropy (S):** Entropy traditionally increases with time as systems approach equilibrium. In Causal Relativity, entropy is considered the measure of spatial disorder or the uniformity of energy distribution across causal spheres.

- **Heat Transfer in Space:** Instead of dividing by temperature (which involves time), we look at the spatial increase in entropy due to the spread of energy.

**Causal Relativity Equation:**

\[ dS = \Delta S_{\text{space}} \]

- **Derivation Logic:** As energy spreads spatially from high to low energy regions, entropy increases, reflecting a move towards a more uniform spatial energy configuration. Here, \(\Delta S_{\text{space}}\) represents the spatial change in entropy, indicating the system's tendency to maximize spatial homogeneity.

#### **Third Law of Thermodynamics:**

**Original Form:**
\[ S \rightarrow 0 \text{ as } T \rightarrow 0 \]

**Derivation in Causal Relativity:**

- **Entropy at Absolute Zero:** As a system approaches absolute zero, all molecular motion (which can be seen as spatial activity) stops, leading to minimum entropy.

- **Spatial Activity:** In this context, we consider spatial activity as the equivalent of thermal motion. As spatial activity approaches zero, so does the entropy.

**Causal Relativity Equation:**

\[ S_{\text{space}} \rightarrow S_{\text{min}} \text{ as spatial activity } \rightarrow 0 \]

- **Derivation Logic:** The approach to absolute zero in spatial terms means the cessation of all spatial energy exchanges and movements, leading to the lowest possible entropy state where no further spatial energy redistribution can occur.

#### **Conclusion:**

We have derived versions of the thermodynamic laws within Causal Relativity, suggesting that energy conservation, entropy increase, and the approach to minimum entropy can all be understood through spatial interactions. These derivations are theoretical and would require experimental or observational validation to confirm their applicability in describing physical phenomena without invoking time. This spatial reinterpretation of thermodynamics opens new avenues for understanding complex systems and energy exchanges in a universe where causality is a spatial phenomenon.
