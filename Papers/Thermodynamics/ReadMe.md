Given that the laws of thermodynamics describe energy, entropy, and the behavior of systems in terms of their internal state and interactions, they don't neatly fit into the categories of mass, light, or gravity alone. Instead, they encompass all forms of energy and matter, making them inherently a combination of **Mass + Light + Gravity**. Here's how we can justify this:

- **Mass**: Represents the internal energy content of systems, which thermodynamics deals with.
- **Light**: Energy transfer in the form of heat or electromagnetic waves is a direct concern of thermodynamics.
- **Gravity**: While not always explicitly considered, gravitational potential energy influences thermodynamic systems (like in atmospheric science or stellar interiors).

Therefore, the most fitting category for thermodynamic laws in the context of Causal Spheres would be **Mass + Light + Gravity**, as they involve the interplay of all these elements in terms of energy conservation, entropy, and temperature.

Here's the unified table for the laws of thermodynamics in Causal Relativity:

| Causal Geometry          | Phenomenon                     | Theory              | Original Equations           | Causal Relativity Equation                                 |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Mass + Light + Gravity   | Conservation of Energy         | Thermodynamics      | \(\Delta U = Q - W\)         | \(\Delta U = \Delta Q_{\text{space}} - \Delta W_{\text{space}}\) |
| Mass + Light + Gravity   | Increase in Entropy            | Thermodynamics      | \(dS = \frac{dQ}{T}\)        | \(dS = \Delta S_{\text{space}}\)                           |
| Mass + Light + Gravity   | Minimum Entropy at 0K          | Thermodynamics      | \(S \rightarrow 0\) as \(T \rightarrow 0\) | \(S_{\text{space}} \rightarrow S_{\text{min}}\) as spatial activity \(\rightarrow 0\) |

**Notes:**

- \(\Delta Q_{\text{space}}\) and \(\Delta W_{\text{space}}\) represent the spatial analogs of heat and work transfer, where energy is redistributed spatially rather than temporally.
- \(\Delta S_{\text{space}}\) reflects the change in entropy as a measure of spatial energy distribution homogeneity.
- The third law's spatial interpretation suggests that as spatial activity (akin to molecular motion) approaches zero, the system's entropy reaches a minimum, reflecting the idea of absolute zero in spatial terms.

This table attempts to encapsulate the essence of thermodynamic laws in a framework where causality is spatial, rather than temporal, aligning with the principles of Causal Relativity.
