#### **Abstract:**

This paper explores the laws of thermodynamics within the framework of Causal Relativity, where traditional time-dependent phenomena are reinterpreted through spatial interactions. By considering Alice and Bob's causal spheres, we derive how the first, second, and third laws of thermodynamics might function in a space-only paradigm, providing new insights into energy conservation, entropy, and the approach to absolute zero.

#### **Introduction:**

Thermodynamics, traditionally a time-dependent field, describes how energy transforms and transfers in systems. Here, we examine how these laws manifest in a causal sphere context where time is not a dimension, but causality is maintained through spatial interactions.

#### **Causal Spheres and Thermodynamics:**

- **Alice and Bob's Causal Spheres:** Alice and Bob exist as causal spheres with mass, light, and gravity components. Their interactions within these spheres illustrate thermodynamic principles spatially.

#### **First Law of Thermodynamics:**

**Scenario:** When Alice opens a bottle of sparkling wine, the sudden pressure drop leads to a temperature decrease, causing moisture in the air to freeze. In Causal Relativity, this event is described not by time but by the spatial distribution of energy and matter:

- **Original Equation:** \(\Delta U = Q - W\)

- **Causal Relativity Interpretation:** 

  - **Internal Energy (U):** Defined by the spatial configuration of energy within Alice's sphere.
  - **Heat (Q):** Energy transfer is conceptualized as a change in spatial energy density between spheres.
  - **Work (W):** Work done is the spatial redistribution of energy, altering the causal sphere's structure.

  - **Equation in Causal Relativity:**

    | Causal Geometry | Phenomenon                | Theory              | Original Equations           | Causal Relativity Equation          |
    |-----------------|---------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
    | Light           | Conservation of Energy    | Thermodynamics      | \(\Delta U = Q - W\)         | \(\Delta U = \Delta Q_{\text{space}} - \Delta W_{\text{space}}\) |

    Here, \(\Delta Q_{\text{space}}\) represents the spatial transfer of energy akin to heat, and \(\Delta W_{\text{space}}\) represents work done in changing spatial configurations.

**Discussion:** In this scenario, the energy conservation is maintained through spatial interactions where the decrease in internal energy due to work (expansion) is compensated by a change in spatial energy distribution (cooling).

#### **Second Law of Thermodynamics:**

**Scenario:** Heat transfer from Alice's causal sphere (hotter) to Bob's (colder) occurs when an impermeable wall between them is removed, leading to spatial homogenization of energy:

- **Original Statement:** Heat does not spontaneously flow from colder to hotter.

- **Causal Relativity Interpretation:**

  - **Entropy (S):** In this framework, entropy is conceptualized as the spatial disorder or homogeneity of energy distribution within and between causal spheres.

  - **Equation in Causal Relativity:**

    | Causal Geometry | Phenomenon                | Theory              | Original Equations           | Causal Relativity Equation          |
    |-----------------|---------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
    | Light           | Increase in Entropy      | Thermodynamics      | \(dS = \frac{dQ}{T}\)        | \(dS = \Delta S_{\text{space}}\)    |

    Here, \(\Delta S_{\text{space}}\) represents the change in spatial entropy, indicating a move towards spatial homogeneity.

**Discussion:** The second law in Causal Relativity reflects the tendency of systems to reach a state of maximum spatial uniformity of energy, akin to maximum entropy.

#### **Third Law of Thermodynamics:**

**Scenario:** As Alice's causal sphere cools towards absolute zero, the spatial activity within her sphere diminishes:

- **Original Statement:** The entropy of a system approaches a minimum at absolute zero.

- **Causal Relativity Interpretation:**

  - **Entropy at Absolute Zero:** As spatial activity (and thus energy distribution) reduces to near zero, entropy approaches a minimum value spatially.

  - **Equation in Causal Relativity:**

    | Causal Geometry | Phenomenon                | Theory              | Original Equations           | Causal Relativity Equation          |
    |-----------------|---------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
    | Light           | Minimum Entropy at 0K    | Thermodynamics      | \(S \rightarrow 0\) as \(T \rightarrow 0\) | \(S_{\text{space}} \rightarrow S_{\text{min}}\) as spatial activity \(\rightarrow 0\) |

**Discussion:** In this spatial context, reaching absolute zero means all spatial interactions cease, leading to the minimum possible entropy state.

#### **Conclusion:**

This paper proposes a spatial interpretation of thermodynamics within Causal Relativity, where fundamental laws are expressed through the spatial interactions of causal spheres. While this approach requires further theoretical and experimental validation, it offers a novel perspective on how energy, work, and entropy might operate in a universe where time is not a dimension but causality is maintained through spatial relations.
