#### **Abstract:**

This paper explores the reformulation of key electrodynamic principles within the framework of Causal Relativity, where traditional temporal dynamics are replaced with spatial causality. We focus on adapting Maxwell's equations, Jefimenko's equations, and Liénard–Wiechert potentials to a time-less universe where mass, light, and gravity interact spatially, forming what we call 'causal spheres.'

#### **Introduction:**

Electrodynamics traditionally describes the behavior of electric and magnetic fields over time. In Causal Relativity, we propose these fields are manifestations of spatial causality, where interactions occur within and between causal spheres without the need for time. This paper aims to derive these fundamental equations in a context where all dynamics are spatial.

#### **Theoretical Framework:**

- **Causal Spheres:** These represent entities where mass, light, and gravity are unified into spatial constructs. Interactions between these spheres mimic what would conventionally be described as temporal changes in electromagnetic fields.

#### **Maxwell's Equations in Causal Relativity:**

**1. Electromagnetic Wave Propagation:**

**Original Form:**
\[ \nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} \]

**Derivation in Causal Relativity:**

- **Causal Interpretation:** Instead of time derivatives, we use spatial derivatives to describe how electric fields change spatially due to the curvature and distribution of magnetic fields in space.

**Causal Relativity Equation:**
\[ \nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\kappa \nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} \]

- **Derivation Logic:** Here, \(\kappa\) represents a spatial propagation constant, adapting the temporal change into spatial causality. This equation suggests that changes in the electric field are due to spatial variations in the magnetic field, not temporal ones.

**2. Electromagnetic Induction:**

**Original Form:**
\[ \nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J} + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} \]

**Derivation in Causal Relativity:**

- **Causal Interpretation:** Induction is reconsidered in terms of spatial current distribution and spatial changes in the electric field.

**Causal Relativity Equation:**
\[ \nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J} + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \kappa \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} \]

- **Derivation Logic:** The term \(\kappa \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E}\) replaces the time derivative, indicating that changes in magnetic fields are induced by spatial variations in electric fields and currents.

**3. Light Wave Equation in Vacuum:**

**Original Form:**
\[ \nabla^2 \mathbf{E} - \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{E}}{\partial t^2} = 0 \]

**Derivation in Causal Relativity:**

- **Causal Interpretation:** The wave equation is adapted to describe electromagnetic waves propagating through space without temporal dependency.

**Causal Relativity Equation:**
\[ (1 - \kappa^2) \nabla^2 \mathbf{E} = 0 \]

- **Derivation Logic:** This equation implies that electromagnetic waves exist as spatial oscillations, where \(\kappa\) accounts for the spatial causality affecting wave propagation.

#### **Jefimenko's Equations:**

**Original Form:** Complex, depending on charge and current distribution.

**Derivation in Causal Relativity:**

- **Causal Interpretation:** Jefimenko's equations are reformulated to account for spatial causality rather than retardation due to time.

**Causal Relativity Equation:**
- **Spatial causality terms replacing temporal derivatives:** The exact form requires further derivation, but the idea is to express field changes as functions of spatial interactions rather than temporal delays.

#### **Liénard–Wiechert Potentials:**

**Original Form:**
\[ \phi = \frac{q}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{1}{\left| \mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_q(t_{\text{ret}}) \right| - \frac{\mathbf{v}_q(t_{\text{ret}})}{c} \cdot (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_q(t_{\text{ret}}))} \]

**Derivation in Causal Relativity:**

- **Causal Interpretation:** We remove the time retardation effect, focusing on spatial causality.

**Causal Relativity Equation:**
- **Spatial causality terms replacing retardation time:** This would involve expressing potentials as functions of spatial coordinates and the spatial effects of moving charges, though the exact form is speculative and needs further derivation.

#### **Conclusion:**

This paper has attempted to adapt core electrodynamic concepts to a universe governed by spatial causality rather than temporal evolution. The derivations suggest that electromagnetic phenomena can be understood through spatial interactions, although practical implications and experimental validations are necessary to further substantiate these theoretical adaptations.
