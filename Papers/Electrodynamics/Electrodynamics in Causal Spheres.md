#### **Abstract:**

This paper explores electrodynamics within the framework of Causal Relativity, where electromagnetic fields and their propagation are considered through spatial interactions rather than temporal dynamics. We use a thought experiment involving Alice and Bob to illustrate how electromagnetic radiation, traditionally understood through Maxwell's equations and other field equations, might be reinterpreted in terms of causal spheres.

#### **Introduction:**

Electrodynamics deals with the study of electromagnetic fields, including the propagation of electromagnetic waves, the interaction of charges, and how these phenomena are affected by relativity. We reinterpret these dynamics within a space-only paradigm where causality is maintained spatially.

#### **Causal Spheres and Electrodynamics:**

- **Alice and Bob's Causal Spheres:** Imagine Alice and Bob as two entities, each with their own causal sphere, where mass, light, and gravity interact. Here, electromagnetic phenomena are the result of interactions between these spheres.

#### **Thought Experiment:**

**Scenario:** Alice has a changing electric charge, creating an electromagnetic field that propagates outward. This field travels through space, influencing Bob's causal sphere when it reaches him.

- **Electromagnetic Wave Propagation:** The wave travels through the vacuum at the speed of light, which in Causal Relativity is the speed of causality. 

- **Interactions:**
  - **Charge Distribution Changes**: Alice's charge distribution changes, which would normally be felt over time. In this framework, these changes are felt spatially through the causal spheres' interactions.
  - **Field Propagation**: The electromagnetic field from Alice's sphere spreads spatially, affecting Bob's sphere through spatial causality rather than time.

#### **General Field Equations:**

In traditional electrodynamics:

- **Jefimenko's Equations** describe the electric and magnetic fields from any charge and current distribution, accounting for the retardation due to the finite speed of light.
- **Liénard–Wiechert Potentials** for point charges offer a more specific description of fields around a moving charge.

**Causal Geometry Category:** Given that electrodynamics involves both electric (light) and magnetic fields, which in classical contexts propagate through space with time, we categorize it under **Light + Gravity** in Causal Relativity. Gravity is included because the propagation of fields in space can be influenced by gravitational effects, even though traditionally, these effects are minor for electromagnetic waves in most contexts.

Here's the table summarizing the equations adapted for Causal Relativity:

| Causal Geometry       | Phenomenon                | Theory              | Original Equations                                                                 | Causal Relativity Equation                                                                 |

| Light + Gravity       | Liénard–Wiechert Potentials | Electrodynamics    | \(\phi = \frac{q}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{1}{\left| \mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_q(t_{\text{ret}}) \right| - \frac{\mathbf{v}_q(t_{\text{ret}})}{c} \cdot (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_q(t_{\text{ret}}))}\)<br> \(\mathbf{A} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{q\mathbf{v}_q(t_{\text{ret}})}{\left| \mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_q(t_{\text{ret}}) \right| - \frac{\mathbf{v}_q(t_{\text{ret}})}{c} \cdot (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_q(t_{\text{ret}}))}\) | Spatial causality terms replacing retardation time; exact equations are speculative here   |

**Notes:**

- **\(\kappa\)**: Represents a spatial causality coefficient, similar to how time derivatives are replaced in Maxwell's equations in Causal Relativity.
- **Retardation**: The concept of retardation in traditional electrodynamics would be replaced by a spatial causality model where the effect of charge changes is felt through spatial interactions rather than delayed by time.

#### **Conclusion:**

This thought experiment and theoretical derivation suggest that electromagnetic phenomena could be described within Causal Relativity by focusing on spatial causality, where changes in charge and current distributions directly influence spatial fields without invoking time. This approach requires further theoretical development to fully integrate with known electromagnetic phenomena, especially concerning the propagation of fields in curved space or near massive objects where gravity's influence is more pronounced.
