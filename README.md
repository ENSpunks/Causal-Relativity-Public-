### **Abstract**

The **Theory of Causal Relativity** is a theory of relativity in a space without time. **Causal Relativity Equations** derived from Relativity are purely spatial and can be used to successfully calculate and predict relativistic effects.  

---

### **Introduction**

**Theory of Causal Relativity** is a mathematical framework for relativity without spacetime or a time dimension. 

---

### **Postulates of Relativity**

**Newton's Postulates**:

1. Space and time are absolute and separate.
2. Gravity acts instantaneously.
3. Light speed varies with observers.

**Einstein's Postulates**:

1. Physics laws are consistent across inertial frames.
2. Light speed is constant.
3. Space and time form a 4D spacetime.

**Causal Relativity Postulates**:

1. Laws of physics are frame independent.
2. Mass/energy has quantum properties and a location in space where it curves space.
3. Gravity and Light propagate at a constant speed relative to curvature caused by mass.
4. Mass, light, and gravity unify causality in space without time.

### **Causal Geometry**

**Causal Relativity** introduces **Causal Geometry** a novel framework where traditional spacetime is reimagined through spatial interactions alone utilizing the concept of Causal Spheres.

**Primary Spheres**

Mass (m): For Alice, her mass sphere represents her presence in space, curving it around her due to her mass-energy. This sphere is fundamental to her causal influence.

Light (l): Alice's light sphere represents the emission and propagation of photons from her mass. These photons are not detached but remain spatially connected, forming part of her causal influence.

Gravity (g): Alice's gravity sphere illustrates the curvature of space due to her mass, influencing the trajectory of objects and light around her.

**Element Spheres**

Special Relativity (l+g): When considering Alice's light and gravity spheres together, they describe effects like length contraction and time dilation as spatial phenomena. Light moving through Alice's gravitational field causes spatial distortions.

General Relativity (m+l): Combining Alice's mass and light spheres, this illustrates how light bends around her mass, akin to gravitational lensing, but now understood as spatial effects within her causal sphere.

General Relativity (m+g): The interaction of Alice's mass and gravity spheres shows how her mass affects the curvature of space, leading to spatial dilation effects traditionally associated with time dilation.

**Unified Causal Spheres**

Causal Sphere (m+l+g): Alice's full causal sphere integrates mass, light, and gravity, providing a comprehensive spatial framework for causality relative to her. This sphere encapsulates all relativistic effects in a spatial context, applicable to any observer's inertial frame.

**Interactions in a 1-Body System**

Alice's Primary Spheres Relative to Alice: In a single entity system, Alice's mass sphere defines her spatial presence. Her light sphere shows how her emitted photons remain within her causal influence, and her gravity sphere describes how she affects her own local space. Here, self-interaction is minimal as her light doesn't affect her gravity directly, maintaining E = mc^2 within her sphere.

**Interactions in a 2-Body System**

Alice's Primary Spheres Relative to Bob:  When Bob enters Alice's vicinity, their causal spheres begin to interact.

Mass Interaction: Alice's mass sphere influences Bob's space, causing gravitational attraction or repulsion based on their relative positions.

Light Interaction: Alice's light shell interacts with Bob's causal sphere, potentially affecting Bob's perception of light from Alice due to spatial curvature.

Gravity Interaction: The gravity spheres overlap, leading to changes in the spatial curvature around both Alice and Bob, affecting their trajectories and potentially leading to phenomena like frame-dragging or tidal forces.

Bob's Primary Spheres Relative to Alice: Similarly, Bob's mass, light, and gravity spheres interact with Alice's. Bob's mass curves space around Alice, his light affects her light sphere, and his gravity interacts with Alice's, creating a dynamic system where energy and mass are exchanged spatially.

Interactions in an N-Body System: 

Multiple Entities: In a system with multiple entities, each individual's causal sphere overlaps with others.

Overlapping Causal Spheres: Each entity's mass, light, and gravity spheres contribute to a complex spatial environment. The interaction of these spheres leads to collective gravitational effects, light bending, and energy distributions.

Spatial Dynamics: The resultant spatial dynamics can explain phenomena like the formation of gravitational wells, the bending of light paths, and the spatial distribution of energy, all without invoking time as a separate dimension. Each entity's influence is felt through the spatial overlap of their causal spheres.

### **Causal Relativity Equations**

Causal Relativity equations often look similar to the original because the spatial interpretation of these phenomena in relativistic contexts typically does not alter the fundamental equations, but changes how we interpret them.

### **Conclusion**

Causal Relativity is a mathematical framework consistent with Relativity, unifies Special and General Relativity dilations into a single spatial phenomena, and predicts  resolutions to Black Hole and the Big Bang singularities in a Timeless Space.
